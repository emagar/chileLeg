Previous research established that urgency and the likelihood of bill passage go hand in hand in Chile. Pending is verification that closed rules do in fact dispel amendments---a key and untested premise of our approach.

This paper has argued that the importance of the urgency authority lies in allowing presidents to shield desired policy from amendments in the floor of the assembly, much more than in setting deadlines for consideration of legislation. We have portrayed urgency authority, found in seven Latin American constitutions, as equivalent to the fast-track authority that United States presidents enjoy periodically. That is, proposals that presidents qualify as urgent are considered under restrictive rules by the chamber's plenary, they must be voted up-or-down, without amendments. While all seven constitutions remain silent about prodecural implications of urgencies, and we have verified that our characterization matches Chilean sub-constitutional institutions only, it is plausible and likely that others do too. After all, the rationale of the urgency authority is expediting the legislative process, and restrictive rules are a natural choice to speed urgent bills' consideration before an explicit deadline expires. 

The classification of constitutional urgency authority by means of the consequences of inaction into the plenary arrest (Brazil), automatic adoption (Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay), and indeterminate (Chile, Colombia, Mexico) variants naturally brings two items to the fore of the agenda for future research. One is verification of sub-constitutional institutions, especially where urgency is indeterminate as it is in Chile, in search of hints of closed rules towards the plenary consideration of draft laws. The other is to model the bargaining logic of the plenary arrest and automatic adoption variants in search of similarities and differences with the urgency-as-fast-track. These efforts will generalize our argument beyond Chile. 

Our formal model of urgency-as-fast-track authority shows that preference overlap between the president and the reporting committee is the mechanism driving the choice to put bills on the fast-track. The reverse applies: bills referred to opposition committees, who might report with fundamental changes, will be lilelier to be considered under open rules so that the majority can restore the original intent of the president and her party. A systematic analysis of proposals in the Chilean lower chamber in recent years finds evidence that, other things constant, bills reported by committees chaired by members of the president's coalition/party are about twice as likely to be fast-tracked than the rest. To the extent that parties and coalitions indicate preference overlap (as is accepted in Chile), the evidence supports our main theoretical result.

Our results and findings are of natural interest to students of comparative political institutions, especially those interested in unorthodox legislative procedure and separation of powers. They also shed light in the field of American Politics. In a provocative book, \citet{howell.moe.Relic2016} make an argument in favor of giving U.S.\ presidents permanent fast-track authority not limited to trade agreements. In order to have a coherent and effective government, they argue in favor of constitutional reform to put the executive at the center of the legislative process: ``presidents should be granted enhanced agenda-setting powers to propose bills to Congress, which Congress should then be required to vote on without amendment, on a strictly majoritarian basis, within a fixed period of time'' (145). Failure to vote in due time would turn those bills into law. Equating urgency and fast-track authorities shows this to be the automatic adoption variant. Reform would therefore make U.S./ presidents similar to those in Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. 

Another element we left out for the sake of parsimony is the intersection of urgency and executive decree authorities, two distinctive institutions of Latin American presidentialism. Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador in fact have both. We have established that, while giving the executive power to make policy unilaterally, fast-track authority is not dictatorial. This resonates with scholarship on decrees: Congress retains authority to reject both urgent proposals and decrees, and cannot therefore be made worse-off than the status quo. So are urgency and executive decrees substitutes or complements in presidents' lawmaking toolbox? Executive decrees grant first-move advantage and forces legislators to respond to the president's proposal instead of the status quo. Might them, as emergency measures, also contain provisions that make introducing floor amendments more restrictive and, consequently, play against urgency authority's relevance? \citet[][:164]{figueiredo.limongi.2000} report that urgent bills in Brazil are quite rare since the provisional decree ``is a much more efficient way of speeding up and approving legislation.'' This question deserves attention too. 
% But, our model shows, the associated closed rule buys presidents substantial influence in lawmaking through selection (or, perhaps, even direct negotiation with committee chairs) of reports strategically allocating the bulk of gains in her favor. 

Previous research established that urgency and the likelihood of bill passage go hand in hand in Chile. Pending is verification that closed rules do in fact dispel amendments---a key and untested premise of our approach. A direct and systematic contrast of laws that presidents drafted in the period, the amendments that were introduced, the committee reports, and the text ultimately adopted will demonstrate whether or not urgencies in fact ``dodge'' amendments is a promising venue for future scholarship. 

Last, our investigation contributes to the literature on restrictive procedures. To the general class of procedures as instruments of political control, we add the urgency authority. One difference sets fast-track mechanisms apart from standard closed rules. Those give agenda power to legislators---it may be the plenary (McNollGast), standing committees (Weingast), the bicameral conference (shepsle and weingast), or the majority party \citep{cox.mccubbins.1997}. Urgency puts the executive in control of protecting vulnerable agreements. The unique role and function to determine whether or not a major bill will be considered in the U.S. House, and which amendments and motions will be allowed, is firmly in control of the legislative leadership, acting as sole gatekeepers to the plenary \citep{cox.2006,dion.huber.1996}. As with France's \emph{vote bloqué}, fast-track authority lets the executive branch pull some of the gatekeeping levers, earning a priceless legislative prerrogative worthy of further research.

Every agreement made between legislators, usually in committee, is vulnerable unless there is some way to shield it from being undone in plenary consideration. Closed rules, which play a key role in congressional politics, offer such protection, preventing amendments during the bill's discussion in the floor. In the U.S.\ House, the allowable number of amendments is set in advance by the Rules Committee \citep{dion.huber.1996,krehbielRestrictiveRules1997,cox.mccubbins.1997}. An interesting implication of urgency-as-fast-track authority is that another branch gets the power to protect deals in this fashion. By deciding which bills proceed to the floor with a closed rule, the president has the ability to defend her legislative proposals. That ability extends to other proposals: the president can also broker deals to defend proposals that legislators make, another vantage point in executive-legislative relations.

Structured thus, fast-track authority equips the executive with the ability to apply a restrictive rule on floor consideration. The restriction consists of precluding the second round of amendments. Figure \ref{f:agendaUrg} portrays this as a break mid-way in the consideration process. When in the fast-track, if $p_1$ were admitted the floor's choice set would include $q$, $p$, and $p_1$ only. At its most restrictive---when $p_1$ is removed from the menu---the floor is presented with a take-it-or-leave-it urgent proposal $p$.

This paper claims that fast-track authority gives presidents the ability to protect bills and agreements from undesirable amendments, transforming the president into the sole member of a Rules Committee of sorts, with the unique ability to impose closed rules on the floor. This guarantees a faster approval process but also protects presidential preferences. The next section analyzes the conditions under which presidents constrain the amendment process on the floor.
