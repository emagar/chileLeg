Dear Editors,

Please accept the attached manuscript entitled "Presidents on the Fast Track: Fighting Floor Amendments with Restrictive Rules" for review.  The paper is co-authored by Valeria Palanza, Gisela Sin, and myself. We analyze the urgency authority, a lesser-known legislative power of many presidents. We highlight the similarity with the fast track authority of American presidents. Analysis of original data from Chile confirms the key result of our formal model. We build upon work by Cox and McCubbins, Howell and Moe, Dion and Huber, Alem√°n and Navia, among others. The paper should interest students of executive-legislative relations and parliamentary procedures, in comparative but also in American politics. 

Yours sincerely, 

Eric Magar (corresponding author)
