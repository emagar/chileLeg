\section{In the law}

Formal authority to meddle with the Congressional agenda is established in the Constitution (art.\ 47) and in the Congressional Organic Law (arts.\ 26 and 27). The president has the constitutional power to urge action on any bill in ``one or all'' legislative process stages (\emph{trámites}). The chamber in question is compelled to act on the bill before a specific deadline. The law defines the breadth of the interference, giving the president a choice between a 30-day deadline (simple urgency), a 15-day (extreme urgency), or 6-day (immediate discussion). While the constitution grants the executive discretion to summon exhaustion of fewer than all remainder stages of a bill---eg., only a committee is mandated to report the bill to the floor, then the urgency ends)---the law seems to take full exhaustion as default. Urgency triples for bills in bicameral conference committee (\emph{comisión mixta}) as the deadline applies to remainder congressional stages, not just a chambers. Were a bill in conference to receive an immediate discussion motion, the conference has two days to report the bill, and the lower and upper chambers two days each to move and vote the bill in the floor (http://www.bcn.cl/ecivica/formacion/). 

President can remove urgency motion at will, with immediate effects.
