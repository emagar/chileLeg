Title: Medida provis\'oria (e urgente): executive unilateral policy and unilateral scheduling in Brazil

Author: Eric Magar (ITAM)

Abstract: Unlike presidents with mostly (or only) reactive formal powers in the legislative arena, Brazil's enjoys formidable proactive ones. Unilateral policy powers (medidas provis\'orias) have received scholarly attention. Much less is known about the urgency authority. A bill declared urgent confronts legislators with a short deadline to discuss and vote it, else it takes precedence in the voting schedule. And few have recognized that every medida provis\'oria gets urgent status upon publication. The paper explores urgency authority incidence between 1995 and 2010 in an attempt to show how presidents have used it to buy support for difficult proposals in exchange for helping coalition proposals clear obstructions in the legilative process.
