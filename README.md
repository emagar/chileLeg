# Files in the repository and how to cite them

You are free to download and modify the data (see the LICENSE document for details) provided you give proper credit to this source. 
Unless otherwise noted next to the file descriptor, the cite is Eric Magar (2018) Legislative bill histories in contemporary Chile repository, <https://github.com/emagar/chileLeg>.

In general, file names identify the office elected (i.e., **df**, **se**, **pr**, **dl**, **go**, **ay** for *diputados federales*, *senadores*, *presidente*, *diputados locales*, *gobernador*, and *ayuntamiento*, respectively), followed by the unit of observation (i.e., **ed**, **df**, **dl**, **mu**, **de**, **se**, **ca** for *estado*, *distrito federal*, *distrito local*, *municipio*, *demarcación*, *sección*, and *casilla* respectively), and the years included. Other than in Nayarit since 2008 (and, pending a court case, Mexico City since 2018), *ayuntamientos* are elected in fused ballots for a *presidente municipal* and a fraction of the municipal council (*regidores* and *síndicos*). Nayarit elects these members of the municipal council in single-member plurality districts called *demarcaciones*.

-   `data/aymu1977-present.csv` = updated to 2013, can be processed with code/ay.r in order to systematize coalitions (ie., aggregate votes when member parties' returns are reported separately and remove redundant columns).
-   `data/aymu1985-present.coalAgg.csv` = pre-processed version of the above (starting in 1985) so that coalition votes appear properly aggregated.
-   `data/ayde2008-presentNayRegid.csv` = Nayarit's municipal demarcaciones vote returns since 2008.
-   `code/ay.r` = script to manipulate *ayuntamiento* returns.
-   `code/ayClean.r` = script used to clean *ayuntamiento* returns, should be unnecessary unless new data are added because output has been saved into csv file.
-   `data/dfdf1979-on.csv`

# Codebook

Most variables are included in every file, some appear in selected files only.

-   *edo* = state abbreviation (may differ form the 'official' abbreviations so that sorting them alphabetically preserves the order set by *edon*).
-   *disn* = district number.
-   *emm* = municipal indentifying code (*edo*-electionCycle./munn/).
-   *mun* = municipality.
-   *munn*, *inegi*, *ife* = municipal identifier, reporting the number and the codes used by INEGI and IFE, respectively.
-   *yr*, *mo*, *dy* = year, month, day of the election.
-   *cab* = cabecera, district's administrative center.
-   *circ* = PR district (circunscripcion electoral, 2nd tier).
-   *v01*, *v02*, &#x2026; = raw vote for candidate 1, 2, etc.
-   *l01*, *l02*, &#x2026; = label of candidate 1's, 2's, &#x2026; party or coalition.
-   *c01*, *c02*, &#x2026; = candidate 1's, 2's, &#x2026; name.

Variable *imputacion* lists what earlier election was used for this purpose ('no' if none carried); *dist* variables report the share of the coalition total attributable to PAN, PRI, and PRD, respectively. See [this](https://github.com/emagar/replicationMaterial/blob/master/gubCoat/onlineAppendix.pdf) for details.
