There
are
three
degrees
of
urgency
that
presidents
can
choose
from:
simple,
supreme,
and
immediate
discussion
(also
elaborated
in
the
appendix).
The
distinction
matters
because
standing
rules
in
the
period
under
study,
mandated
that
\emph
{only}
supreme
urgency
qualification
triggered
restrictive
floor
consideration
rules,
whereas
the
highest
and
lowest
degrees
did
not.
For
this
reason,
and
unless
otherwise
noted,
by
`urgency'
in
Chile
we
mean
`supreme
urgency'.

All
this

accurately.
Unless
there
is
unanimous
support
to
suspend
the
chamber's
rules,
every
bill
requires
a
committee
report
prior
to
floor
consideration
(Chilean
Congress'
Organic
Law,
art.~21).
No
explicit
discharge
procedure
exist.
Furthermore,
committee
chairs
have
agenda
setting
powers
comparable
to
those
in
the
U.S.
Congress,
their
prerogatives
include
complete
control
of
committee
procedures,
agenda,
decision
to
hold
secret

the
rejection
of
