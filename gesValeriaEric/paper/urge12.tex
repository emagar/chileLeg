\begin{abstract}
\noindent  Among Presidents' formidable proactive legislative powers is fast-track authority, sometimes called urgency authority. The US president may be granted this authority and seven Latin American presidents have the constitutional prerogative to impose on lawmakers a short deadline to discuss and vote bills using this track. Yet fast track mechanisms are not always intended to speed legislation along. While in most cases non-compliance with the deadline has consequences for the legislature, there are cases where the absence of congressional action before the deadline brings no consequences. This paper proposes that fast track mechanisms may conceal motivations unrelated to speed. Extant research on Chile has shown that most executive proposals become urgent at some stage, and that urgency correlates with the odds of passage, but it found little evidence that it speeds consideration of the president's agenda in Congress. We suggest that the main reason behind the use of fast-track authority in Chile is to give presidents the ability to shield bills coming from friendly committees from floor amendments. Thus, instead of being a mechanism to speed up the process, presidents' fast-track authority is similar to imposing a "closed rule" on the floor. The paper tests hypotheses derived from a formal model of restrictive rules using data from Chile during 1998--2014.

%Comentarios a Magar: Presidential obstruction of the agenda in Chile’s Congress
%Buenísimo el paper. Siempre me pareció muy interesante el tema de las urgencias y no existen análisis sistemáticos de estos procesos. Tengo muchas ganas de ver el libro completo una vez que esté terminado. 
%En términos generales me gusta mucho la perspectiva y el modelo es interesante. El juego está descripto con poco detalle (supongo que eso viene en otros capítulos) así que la presentación de la Figura 2 y su discusión en las páginas 10 y 11 siguen siendo un poco crípticos. La intuición se entiende, pero el hecho de que en distintos sistemas k y o toman distintos valores y producen distintos equilibrios necesita más fundamentación (de nuevo, asumo que eso viene de capítulos anteriores del libro). 
%El capítulo preguntando porque los legisladores toman en consideración las “urgencias” cuando a diferencia de Brasil o Uruguay no existe un mecanismo de sanción si ellos “shirk”. No tenemos respuesta a lo largo del capítulo y mi impresión es que se necesita un poco mas de data cualitativa (algunas entrevistas o discusiones de diarios de sesiones) que digan porque los legisladores atienden al pedido del presidente. Esto quizá afecte como pensas el modelo de la Figura 2 y te convendría resolverlo antes de cerrar el capítulo.
%Mi preocupación principal está en la forma en que usas la data y como estimas el modelo. Las “urgencias” son un mecanismo para presionar al Congreso para que actúe y, por tanto, tienen que ser modelados con una función de tiempo. Lo más natural para mí sería utilizar un “mixture” model que mide al mismo tiempo la “tasa” de aprobación y el “tiempo” de aprobación (te anexo un artículo en el cual hacemos esto para el caso de Uruguay con Chasquetti). Entiendo que las “urgencias” son una forma de presionar al Congreso para resolver favorablemente, pero la discusión sobre el “scheduling” del plenario también refiere al problema del costo de oportunidad de tratar los proyectos del Presidente en lugar de los proyectos de los legisladores. Sin embargo, todos los Congresos tienen mecanismos para permitir que los “pet projects” sean aprobados cuando hay tiempos limitados en el plenario. En Brasil las comisiones pueden dar aprobación final a una gran cantidad de projectos (“terminativa”) para evitar consumir el tiempo del plenario. En Argentina el artículo 133 del reglamento permite votar en paquete proyectos que tienen dictamen de comisión y no tienen objeciones ni enmiendas. Por lo tanto, existen cambios en las reglas que les permiten a los legisladores “circunvent” las restricciones de tiempo del plenario. Para mi es necesario modelar el éxito relativo y el tiempo de aprobación para ver que es lo que están haciendo las urgencias.
%Esto también quiere decir que el modelo de estimación debería ser al nivel de proyecto de ley y no un OLS con sumas de instancias. Sino me equivoco tenes toda esa data, el N es mas grande y además te permite combinar data a nivel de proyecto, de legislador y de Congreso. Así que a mi juicio conviene cambiar la estrategia de estimación. 
%Por lo demás, me parece un excelente artículo y me muero de ganas de ver el libro.
%Abrazo. E.

% En Chile se llama urgencia, en Mx iniciativa preferente. Cómo se llama en Colombia etc? La lectura semántica quizás sesgó la interpretación de Morgenstern y cia.

% Adrián:
%
%% Hola Eric,
%
%% Muy bueno el paper. Me parece que la colaboración presidente-comités es muy interesante, y además de ver qué proyectos son declarados urgentes, el modelo probablemente tiene otras implicaciones que pueden desarrollar después.
%
%% Como te dije, acá te mando un par de comentarios adicionales:
%
%% 1. No estoy seguro si el comienzo de la sección 2 (pp. 4-6) es el mejor lugar para discutir la data y los tipos de proyectos de urgencia. Tal vez sería mejor comenzar con el ejemplo y el modelo (más algunos ejemplos de la vida real) y recién al ir al caso de Chile discutir los datos y los distintos tipos de urgencia.
% R: done.
%
%% 2. Una cosa que no me quedó 100% clara, y se podría aclarar: ¿lo de los distintos tipos de proyectos de urgencia está en la Constitución, o en los estatutos del Congreso?
%  R: lo decimos en el texto y elaboramos en una nota a pie.
%
%% 3. En la presentación mencionaste distintos tipos de quórum para distintos tipos de proyectos. En la medida en que sea fácil determinar qué tipo de quórum amerita cada proyecto, se podría partir la muestra para ver si los resultados son similares cuando se requiere quórum simple o una mayoría especial, etc.
%
%% 4. Casi todas las variables son dummies entre 0 y 1. La variable Year remaining varía entre 0 y 100, ¿por qué no dividirla por 100 para que quede en la misma escala que el resto?
%
%% Por último, algunas posibles extensiones que tal vez sea mejor discutir en otros trabajos, pero podrían mencionar en la conclusión:
%
%% 5. No me quedó clara la diferencia entre poder de urgencia y poderes de decreto, especialmente cuando hay aprobación automática (e.g., Uruguay). Pero si el presidente puede legislar por decreto, ¿el pleno no tiene que elegir entre el decreto tal como está, o introducirle algo? O sea, ¿el decreto no funciona también como una closed rule? No lo digo por el caso chileno, pero sí para pensar cómo comparar con otros países.
%R (gisela); el decreto es mas fuerte que todo lo que conocemos.  Hasta el fast track authority the Howell y Moe tiene que ser aprobado por el Congreso, pero en Argentina por ejmeplo, los decretos no estan reglamentados y no necesitan ser aprobados por el congreso.  Otra cosa: la gran diferencia seria si los decretos se analizan en comision o no.  En Chile, la comision puede introducir todos los cambios que quiere (y creo que es asi en Brazil, no?) . No se si es asi en Argentina. Este close rule en Chile defiende el bill de amendments no negociadas con el presidente de la comision (que pueden venir de facciones del partido/coalicion gobernante, o de la oposicion).
%
%% 6. ¿El modelo genera algún otro tipo de predicciones? Ustedes están mirando declaración de urgencia, ¿pero es posible predecir qué proyectos deberían morir en el comité, cuáles deberían ser aprobados por el pleno, cuáles recibir enmiendas, etc? Si no es posible predecirlo (o no tienen los datos para evaluar las predicciones), deberían explicar por qué en el paper. Se me hace que muchos reviewers les van a salir con eso.
%
% falta un resumen del paper, predicciones, estrategia empirica etc en intro; mencionar que es más instrumento de colaboración que acelerador. Qué hace el paper?
% No Moe&Howell, sólo que es análogo al fast track de tratados internacionales


% Otros comentarios de la charla en el itam
% 1. Jeff: In US, committee reports original bill and amendments separately, each voted. 	NOT TRUE: REPORTS A BILL DEPENDING ON HOW WAS THE FINAL OUTCOME WITH THE VOTES ON THE AMENDMENTS. IN THE RPORT OF COURSE IT MAKES A SUMMARY OF THE DENATE, THE AMENDMENTS, THE VOTING, WHO OTED FOR WHAT, ETC.  VERY SIMILAR TO CHILE. In Mexico, committee reports its own version. Is it the same in Chile? EMM: Yes, methinks. FEE: Look at original executive proposals and what the committee reports, to see how much change there was. GS: HAHA THAT'S A LOT, LOT OF WORK 
%
% 2. FEE/Adrián: analize exv bills urgent since the beginning vs those declared urgent later. Should hint at how restrictive rules become necessary as exv makes concessions in original bill... 
% GS: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? NOT SURE HOW IT WOULD MATTER, BUT NOT IN THAT WAY. THE RESTRICTION DOE SNOT COUNT FOR COMMITTEES. BUT THE DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE INTERESTING: WHY SOME HAVE URGENCY SINCE THE BEGGINNING? I IMAGINE IT HAS TO DO WITH A SIGNAL FROM THE EXECUTIVE: THE BILL IS IMPORTANT, AND I AM WILLING TO SHIELDED FORM AMENDMENTS IN THE FLOOR IF YOUDO NOT MODIFY IT MUCH. OR MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE: THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME, I'M WILLING TO NEGOTIATE

\section{Introduction}

It is a fact of presidential systems that executives have legislative powers. The most extended presidential legislative prerogative is the veto, yet many other procedures exist that enable presidents to be a part of the lawmaking process alongside congresses. In terms of agenda setting, executive decree powers are a centerpiece in many presidential constitutions. Characterized upon first glance as usurpation of the legislature's decision rights, we know now that countries vary in this regard. Another mechanism that increases presidents' influence in setting the agenda is fast track authority. Fast-track authority gives presidents the power to set the agenda by imposing a requirement to hold a vote on a bill within a certain period of time, allowing the president to interfere with congress' voting schedule and floor control. More specifically, by using this prerogative, presidents can impose a deadline for legislators to discuss and vote bills. 
%Compared to the US presidential system, where an impatient president has no formal resources to push legislators to act on stagnant legislation, broad reaching

Fast-track authority seems to contradict classic notions of separation of powers. In Federalist 47, Madison argues that the ``magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law, though he can put a negative on every law'' \citep{madison.47}. The Framers also warn against expediting lawmaking and arresting deliberation. ``In the legislature promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit'' \citep{hamilton70.1788}.
%Within this view presidents can veto bills, preventing them from becoming law, but cannot force legislators to act on specific measures.


% When a bill declared urgent: Always Needs Legislature Support
%Colombia and Chile: No reversion point if Congress does not comply. Any topic 
%Brazil: it goes to the top of the schedule and all voting activity in the floor stops (45 days)
%USA: International Trade Agreements

%If Legislature does not  act within certain number of days, bill becomes law
%Uruguay: 3/5 of member can remove “urgency” label, no more than 1 urgent bill at a time
%Ecuador: economic issues, limit in number of urgent bills at one time
%Paraguay: any subject
%USA: Howell & Moe (2017) argue for constitutional reform to grant U.S. presidents universal fast track authority 

%\ges{Here we need to make a footnote on the US, that in the US that does not apply for cases where Congress gave the president fast track authority, which has been mostly for Trade agreements with other nations. \\ Not happy about this quote yet, but I think is more appropriate than the previous one.  We need something about separation of powers.}

%\emm{La ventaja de 47 es que enfatiza la separación de poderes. La ventaja de 70 es que subraya la aceleración del proceso, que es lo que la literatura (y el término urgencia) han considerado. Vale[abr-2018] las ha incluido ambas.}

% Upon the principles of a free government, inconveniences from the source just mentioned [collective actors] must necessarily be submitted to in the formation of the legislature; but it is unneccessary, and therefore unwise, to introduce them into the constitution of the executive. It is here too that they may be most pernicious. In the legislature promptitude of decision is oftener an evil than a benefit. The differences of opinion and the jarring of parties in that department of the government, though they may sometimes obstruct salutary plans, yet often promote deliberation and circumspection, and serve to check the excesses of the majority. When a resolution too is once taken, the opposition must be at an end. That resolution is a law, and resistance to it is punishable. --> EMM la urgencia opera contra esta delibaración benévola...
% federalist 47 "The magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law, though he can put a negative on every law" 

Despite these concerns, seven presidential systems of the Americas give executives fast-track authority: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, U.S.A., and Uruguay \citep{morgenstern.2002b}. 
%cite Mercedes Garcia Montero, Nolte, etc. VER MERCEDES BOOK> 
A shared characteristic of fast track authority is that if the legislature fails to act within a certain period, the bill either becomes a law without the legislature's approval, or the whole legislative process comes to a halt until the floor votes on the bill. For example, in Brazil, the president can declare any executive-initiated bill ``urgent'' at any time. The assembly must act on bills marked urgent within forty five days, else the bill takes precedence over all other legislative business. In Uruguay, legislators must act within a pre-specified, short period of time, as failure to do so converts the fast-tracked bill into law.\footnote{However, three-fifths of the membership of either chamber can remove the bill's fast-track status.} Thus, by institutional design, the president has an effective tool to influence the congressional agenda, as she can force Congress to debate and vote on a bill.
%\GES: me parece que aca lo tenemos que dejar asi, con solo estos dos ejemplos y explayarnos mas en el lit review, mas adelante.  Es la intro!

However, it is puzzling that given the presumed motive of achieving a faster pace, some fast track mechanisms are not binding. That is, no formal consequences fall upon legislators not complying with deadlines. Such is the case of Colombia and Chile, for instance. 
 
% ON CHILE - THIS GOES LATER The power of fast track authority in Chile fades when compared to its counterparts in the Americas. Although in Chile any bill can be declared urgent at any time, and the chamber must discuss and vote on the bill within 30 days (depending on the type of urgency), there are no consequences for non-compliance. When the period provided for Congress to act expires, the legislative process does not stop, nor do bills become law automatically. That is, there is no punishment for the legislature if it fails to make a decision within the specified number of days. Indeed, when the deadline for the expedite process is nearing, the president usually removes the previous urgency and issues a new one.  The data shows no difference in the speed of bills declared urgent, which take about 29 weeks until they reach the floor, and the rest, which take about 29.7 weeks. For example, in his study of the urgency prerogative in Chile's first post-transition administration, \citet{siavelis.2002} revealed the high frequency with which President Aylwin qualified bills as urgent, and found mixed evidence on whether such bills had a more expedited legislative process and an improved likelihood of passage. Given that fast track authority does not seem to expedite legislation,one would expect the president not to use them at all. However, this is not the case: about 60 percent of executive proposals are declared urgent during the legislative process. Why?

The existent literature has argued that the benefit of fast-track authority lies in its signaling capacity. Quoting a former legal chief of staff at the Chilean Presidency, \citet{berrios.gamboa.fiscChile.2006} describe simple urgency qualification as ``merely symbolic, exerting no real pressure on Congress'' (p.~117).\footnote{Three types exist in Chile, as we explain below. Simple urgencies provide a thirty day deadline.} Likewise, \citet{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009} see urgencies as ``signals of presidential attention'' (p.~404), so the assembly may face unobserved political costs by ignoring or rejecting salient proposals. 
%\footnote{The president has many other instruments in Chile to signal Congress that an issue is important. For example, the president can do it through the press, etc} 
%I guess my point here is that we should say that there are many other ways by which the president can signal sucha thing?


%Fast track authority can be classified into two main types: a bill on fast track may always need the approval of the legislature, or it may become law if Congress does not act within a certain number of days. Among the first type is the urgency authority present in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and the U.S.  In Colombia, fast-track bills go to the top of the voting schedule immediately, and all activity on the floor stops until legislators vote on the bill. In the U.S., the president has fast track authority on international trade agreements. Among those countries in which an "urgent" bill becomes a lw if the legislature does not approve or reject within a certain number of days, are Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. In Ecuador, the president has fast track authority only on economic matters and can only marked as urgent one bill at a time. In Paraguay, the president can declare urgency on any bill. In Mexico, the president can propose up to two urgent bills at the start of each biannual ordinary period, and these bills must be scheduled for floor consideration within 30 days.\footnote{Constitutional articles vesting this authority are the following: Brazil articles 62 and 64; Chile article 74; Colombia article 163; Mexico article 71; and Uruguay article 168.7.}

\vp{hay trabajos que analicen estos casos? será necesario revisar los findings de esa literatura y compararlos con lo que nosotros proponemos y nuestros findings?}
\ges{Soto dice que Ecuador, Paraguay y Dominicana tienen poderes de urgencia tambien, y cita Base de Datos Politicos de las Americas (2008) de Georgetown University.}
\vp{Eric, qué piensas de esto? será que estos países adoptaron la norma más recientemente?}
%\emm{How does this compare with special (extra-ordinary) sessions? Some presidents can summon legislators to a special session to discuss, exclusively, a specific bill defined ex-ante. Limits? If few, might resemble urgency authority... Check.}
%\ges{Little, if any connection.}
%\vp{we could make a footnote of it, but I'd just leave it}

% ESTO TAMBIEN VA A LIT REVIEW Regarding the United States, \citet[][:145]{howell.moe.Relic2016} provide an argument in favor of providing presidents with fast-track authority. They argue that in order to have coherent, effective government, reform needs to put the president at the center of the legislative process by giving her fast-track powers: ``presidents should be granted enhanced agenda-setting powers to propose bills to Congress, which Congress should then be required to vote on without amendment, on a strictly majoritarian basis, within a fixed period of time. [...] [T]he Constitution would be amended to grant the president \emph{permanent} fast-track authority over \emph{all} policy matters (including budgets and appointments).'' 


This paper builds on the existing literature, but makes a different claim. We argue that counter what one might expect, fast-track authority in Chile is neither a signal nor an agenda setting tool, but instead a mechanism that protects the bills sponsored by the president from changes in the floor. When the president labels a bill as urgent, such bill cannot be amended on the floor. In this way, the fast track authority works as a close rule by locking in the bill as it came out from committee.




\vp{Pienso que aquí habría que vincular esto a la literatura. How does this case speak to the fast-track authority literature? What can those scholars learn from reading this paper? part of our point is that urgencias in Chile are NOT fast-track authority, but rather, a form of imposing a closed rule and locking in policy preferences, no? so how does this relate back to the literature that we claim to speak to?}

We find that the literature has largely ignored this important consequence of the rule: when urgent bills are brought to the floor, \emph{they cannot be modified}.\footnote{This is true since March of 2014. Before then, it was true only for one type of urgency, ``supreme urgency'' (\emph{suma urgencia}).} Legislators have to vote them up or down, with no possibility to introduce amendments.  When qualified as urgent, the bill that emerges from committee is identical to the one passed by the floor. Urgency protects the agreements reached in committee as they cannot be undone later in the plenary session. 

The case of Chile attracts our attention because by means of her fast-track authority, the president is able to decide whether a bill proceeds to the floor with a closed rule, or whether it will be open for amendments. This means that, unlike the U.S., where committee members negotiate with the leadership and the Rules Committee to receive closed rules towards floor consideration, in Chile committee members negotiate with the president to receive that label. In other words, in Chile the president takes on the role of the congressional leadership and Rules Committee all together. 

%This unique presidential prerogative opens the door for multiple strategies both for the committee and the president regarding the conditions under which they will push for a bill to receive the urgency label. 

%We claim that the poor signal given by bills designated urgent in Chile may bear relation to selection bias. Strategic presidents are likely to target bills that differ from the rest in important ways, so that the set of bills receiving urgent status is not random. Right censoring may also be an obstacle. A more fundamental problem is institutional indeterminacy. \citet{berrios.gamboa.fiscChile.2006} warn against overstating the Chilean urgency authority's importance, as non-compliance entails no penalty for Congress. %---unlike the Brazilian, Colombian, and Uruguayan variants.
%This paper argues that the effects of urgency authority are procedural. Proposals the president declares urgent in Chile are considered under restrictive rules by the chamber's plenary. If the rationale is expediting the legislative process, one key consequence is to effectively shield committee reports from amendments by the plenary.

\vp{Como comenté antes, me parece que falta, en lo anterior, ``hints'' hacia la literatura con la que estamos discutiendo, o a la que pretendemos hacer un aporte. Si esa literatura es la de ``fast-track'' y restricted rules, cuáles serían las referencias y cuál la contribución del paper debería decirse en la intro (me gusta esta opción porque nos permite apuntar más alto). Si es la literatura sobre urgencias en chile vis a vis demás países latinoamericanos que tienen la potestad, habría que ver dónde conviene insertar esa discusión.}

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the urgency process in Chile in more detail and presents the data. We elaborate on urgency degrees, a distinction of central importance to the study of this institution in Chile, offering our interpretation of urgency authority as a restrictive rule. Schematizing the sequence of committee reports and plenary readings shows that it is much harder to introduce plenary amendments to urgent than non-urgent bills. Section 3 extends a simple model of restrictive rules from the U.S.\ to the Chilean Congress. The spatial model highlights the logic behind the procedural choice: when the executive anticipates that a palatable committee report is vulnerable to floor amendments, declaring it urgent imposes a take-it-or-leave-it vote on the floor. We derive testable hypotheses. Section 4 tests some of them. Examination of all bills in the 1998--2014 period through multivariate analysis in search of urgency authority predictors shows that, other features constant, bills reported by committees chaired by the president's party/coalition (our measure of preference similarity between the president and the committee chair, driving some theoretical results) associates significantly with urgency messages. Section 5 concludes.

\section{Fast-Track Legislation}

As part of a literature that highlights the extraordinary legislative influence of presidents in Latin America, emphasis has been placed on the Chilean president's exclusive proposal rights for certain bills, her capacity to veto bills totally and partially, and to propose amendments at different stages of the legislative process \citep{baldez.carey.1999,aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009}. Less attention has been devoted to the influence granted the president when she can declare certain bills urgent and by doing so, affect how congress deals with its agenda. We view this influence as stemming from the prerogative to qualify bills ``urgent'', which imposes a form of closed rule for floor consideration, more than, as the current literature sees it, a bill accelerator or a signal of presidential priority. Our argument here joins a growing literature on restrictive rules in legislatures worldwide.\footnote{See \citet{dion.huber.1996,doring.restrictiveRules.2003,huber.1996a,krehbielRestrictiveRules1997,heller.2001,weingast.1992,schickler.richRules1997,cox.mccubbins.1997,amorim.cox.mccubbins.2003,calvo.2014argBook,sin.2014,denhartog.2004phd}, among others.}

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{One proposal and two amendments}\label{T:example}
\noindent \begin{tabular}{llc}
       & original version                   & amendment                                        \\ \hline
Art 1. & appropriate \$200                  & \$300                                            \\
Art 2. & split in two equal parts $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$          & $(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4})$ split \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

A simple example of a bill and two amendments illustrates how urgency qualification works as a restrictive rule. In our example, we consider a proposal made by the executive that aims to offer student grants while also paying for teacher compensations. Three articles, summarized in Table \ref{T:example}, provide different solutions. The first funds the program, appropriating \$200. The second splits the funds into equal parts. And the third allocates the parts. So, if approved, students and teachers would receive \$100 each. To add complexity, assume a prior commitment of \$150 for teachers. To honor this, a member offers an amendment (\emph{indicación}) to article 1. If approved, this would beef up funds to \$300. One problem immediately arises: the Chilean executive has exclusive power to introduce legislation increasing spending (Const.\ art.\ 65). Since the bill itself has already been introduced, it takes some interpretation to determine if the amendment is in fact constitutional or not. Committee chairs decide on the admissibility of amendments on such grounds---a decision that the Lower Chamber's presiding officer can override.\footnote{The Constitutional Organic Law on Congress (arts.\ 24 and 25) leaves discretion to committee chairs and the presiding officer to declare amendments inadmissible. Non-germane amendments, or those that increase spending, or those falling in areas of exclusive executive initiative, are explicitly mentioned as inadmissible.} This is a form of \emph{ex-ante} veto: if unwilling to appropriate extra money, the committee chair or the presiding officer could simply declare the amendment inadmissible. In this case, the distributive route remains practicable: less for students, more for teachers. An amendment to article 2, such that teachers get three-fourths of the \$200 fund, would honor the commitment---at the students' expense. And by leaving spending untouched, it should also make it harder for the chair and presiding officer to argue against admitting the second amendment.

We use the example to stylize the evolution of legislative proposals from introduction to passage, in order to illustrate how urgencies affect bills. We introduce some notation. The three-article project is $p$, and $q$ is the status quo (where students and teachers get \$0 from this particular subsidy). Sub-indexes distinguish versions of $p$ with articles amended: $p_1$ has article 1 amended, $p_2$ has article 2 amended, and $p_{12}$ has both articles amended. Negotiation proceeds in four steps, schematized in Figure \ref{f:agendaUrg} as per \citet[]{schwartz.2008}.\footnote{See the Cámara's standing rules (\emph{Reglamento}), especially arts.\ 118--189.} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The question of amendment $p_1$'s admissibility into the \textbf{first report} starts it all. The choice is by the chamber's presiding officer, who has final authority to overturn the committee chair's decision. Admitting $p_1$ gives way to a course of play that substantially complicates down the tree. 
\item The bill's \textbf{first floor reading} follows (\emph{discusión general}). The question here is whether the full proposal should be admitted for consideration or not. If not, the legislative process ends and the status quo prevails: $p$ v. $q$. Next, a vote to admit any amendments that have been proposed follows. Project $p_1$ (amendment admitted) or $p$ (not) is immediately referred back to committee for a second report. 
\item If the committee concurs, then the \textbf{second report} is the outcome of the first reading. But this is an opportunity for committee members or by legislators external to the committee (with one-third floor backing) to offer new amendments. The committee chair and the presiding officer can fail to admit these amendments too. For the sake of simplicity, the choice here concerns only article 2, although an array of possibilities exist---more re-definitions, more articles, fewer, among others. When amended, the second report is $p_2$ or $p_{12}$, depending on whether the outcome of the first reading was $p$ or $p_1$. 
\item The \textbf{second reading} proceeds one article at a time (\emph{discusión particular}). Importantly, this excludes the subset of articles that were not amended/added/removed in previous steps. This subset (which may include every article if none were amended) is considered adopted with no floor vote. Rejecting article 1's amendment makes the project lose sub-index 1; likewise with article 2. So when the second report is $p_{12}$, the floor can accept one amendment, the other, both, or neither---as in the bottom row of Figure \ref{f:agendaUrg}. 
\end{enumerate}

We underline how the process shortens and becomes simpler when a proposal is fast-tracked. This is a key insight from \citet{sotoCongChile2015}: when the executive fast-tracks a bill, \emph{the bill takes a procedural shortcut}. As per the Lower Chamber's standing rules (arts.~188--9), fast-tracked bills receive no second committee report, and the first and second floor readings (\emph{discusiones general y particular}) take place at once.\footnote{An additional caveat, which we do not elaborate, is that amendments rejected by the committee will only be released for floor reading if thirty deputies,including at least three committee chairs, present a signed request.} 

Urgency authority therefore equips the executive with the ability to apply a restrictive rule on floor consideration. The restriction consists of precluding the second round of amendments. Figure \ref{f:agendaUrg} portrays this as a break mid-way in the consideration process. With urgent consideration, when the presiding officer admits $p_1$ the floor's choice set includes $q$, $p$, and $p_1$ only. At its most restrictive---when the presiding officer removes $p_1$ from the menu---the floor is presented with a take-it-or-leave-it urgent proposal $p$.

This is to say, therefore, that the toolbox of formidable legislative powers of the Chilean president includes the ability to impose restrictive floor consideration rules. In Chile, the president plays the role played by the powerful Rules Committee in the U.S.\ House. In the next section we analyze the conditions under which  Chilean presidents choose different types of rules in the legislative process. 

%% Un perfil de preferencia para ilustrar podria ser el siguiente:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item La mayoría está cerca de los maestros y ordena las alternativas $p_{12}>p_{2}>p_{1}>p>q$ (de mejor a peor)
%% \item El gobierno  $p>q>p_2>p_1>p_{12}$.

\emm{He quitado el veto del modelo [25-abr]. Queda mejor así, más simple.}

%ON CHILE: The Chilean Constitution of 1980 sets the institutional order allocating decision rights across the branches in Chile. Presidents are elected for four-year terms and immediate reelection is forbidden. Legislators are elected through direct elections in two-member districts. Its 120 Lower House representatives are elected for four-year terms, while the thirty-eight senators serve eight-year terms.\footnote{A reform of the electoral system approved in April 2015, increased the number of legislators and proportionality. Changes became effective in the 2017 elections, affecting the new composition of congress.} Throughout the nineties and at least until 2018, parties in Congress have organized in two stable coalitions, the center-left Concertación (later Nueva Mayoría), and the center-right Alianza (later Chile Vamos). 
%ON CHILE: As in other presidential systems, Chilean presidents concentrate considerable legislative power (Siavelis 2002; Payne, 2006; Author, 2017). Their prerogatives include exclusive proposal power in key legislative areas such as the budget, finance, and administration. The president can affect the congressional agenda by marking bills “urgent”, which imposes time constraints on their discussion. She can also propose amendments to bills under consideration. In the twenty-four years between the return to democracy and the end of Piñera’s administration in 2014, a total of 8,483 bills were proposed. The Chilean congress passed 2,617 of those bills (approximately one third). Most of these bills had been marked urgent at some point of their life span, and defying commom sense, some were marked urgent several times. 
%ON CHILE: However, counter mainstream expectations that more powerful presidents use their prerogatives more broadly (O’Donnell 1993, 1994), Chilean politics function in a consensual manner and presidents rarely use their more confrontational prerogatives, such as decrees and total vetoes. As other Latin American presidents, the Chilean president can enact legislation by decree, what Shugart and Carey (1998) term Constitutional Decree Authority. However, between 1990 and 2014 only two decrees were enacted in Chile, as opposed to hundreds enacted in Argentina (694 between 1983 and 2007) and Brazil (744 between 1988 and 2010). This paper assumes that consensual behavior is crafted through institutional procedures. Understanding which procedures are key in this regard is part of this paper's contribution. %It sets out to understand the conditions under which presidents can move along their agendas while maintaining politics consensual. 


We stylize the Chilean urgency authority as a game of restrictive procedures inspired by \citet{dion.huber.1996}, with the president in the role of the Rules Committee. Figure \ref{F:game} portrays the game's extended form. The main features of this game are as follows. Unless there is unanimous support to suspend the chamber's rules, every proposal requires a committee report prior to floor consideration (Organic Law, art.~21). The committee $C$ with jurisdiction over a given proposal starts the game, choosing whether or not to report the bill $x_C$ to the floor. No explicit discharge procedure exists in Chile. This confers committees gate-keeping power over policy in their jurisdiction: when the committee withholds a report, the game ends with policy at the status quo $q$. Chilean committees are no different in this respect from those in the U.S.\ Congress. When producing a report, the committee can approve the proposal in whole or in part, amend it, make additions, or reject it (Cámara standing rule 287.8). We interpret this as (positive) agenda power to locate the proposal in policy space: $x_C \in [0,1]$. THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS HAVE AGENDA SETTING POWERS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY CAN DECIDED WHETHER A BILL WILL BE DISCUSSED AND VOTED ON BY THE COMMITTEE. The president moves next. 

During the legislative process, the president's choice set has two alternatives: let the bill proceed under standard floor consideration, or qualify it as urgent. Standard consideration ends the game with policy at $x_F$. By navigating the plenary session with an open rule, legislators' amendments reshape the bill to the floor median's liking. As in \citet{shepsle.1979}, we take $x_F$ to be the floor median's ideal point, corresponding to a game of full floor influence. However, if the president marks the bill "urgent", this invokes the restrictive consideration rule and presents the floor with a take-it-or-leave-it offer. Unable to amend the proposal, the floor, which moves after the bill was marked urgent, must choose between the reported bill $x_C$ or the status quo, as in \citep{romer.rosenthal.1978}.\footnote{Unlike Dion and Huber's, our game excludes the procedural stage. A rule denial, which ends the game at the status quo, is not available to the Chilean president.}
  
%\vp{But this [open rule] returns the bill to the committee, no?}
%\emm{It does, but only if amendments were in fact introduced. Model totally ignores this. Simplistic? Justifiable? May need some elaboration.}
\ges{I think is good as is, although I'm still not clear in the type of amendments that legislators can introduce in the consideracion en general. Con el ejemplo pareciera que es cualquier tipo de amendment? Me imagino que no, pero no me queda claro como es el tema en la votacion en general.  Si, se vota toda la ley, y los legisladores pueden ofrecer una ley alternativa? si ? no?}

%This ``veto'' is a stylization of events taking place much later in the actual legislative process, after the approved bill lands on the president's desk. For the executive veto to exert an influence so much earlier in the process, players must entertain the expectation that it will be sustained, effectively reinstating the status quo. This tree branch will therefore not be practicable when there is no way to fully discard the possibility of a veto override. The dashed line in Figure \ref{F:game} indicates that the branch may or may not be part of the president's choice set. We analyze versions of the game with (``veto will be sustained'') and without (``veto will be overridden'') the dashed line. 

%This ``veto'' is a stylization of events taking place much later in the actual legislative process, after the approved bill lands on the president's desk. The specific features of the presidential veto in Chile call for a caveat. The veto takes on different forms in Chile, such that the president may choose to veto the bill completely (total veto), or do a number of things to alter the bill partially.\footnote{The president may delete parts of the bill, add parts to the bill, and also change parts of the bill (which combines deleting and adding).} For the executive veto to exert an influence so much earlier in the game, players must entertain the expectation that it will be sustained, effectively reinstating the status quo. In Chile, between 1990 and 2014 only one total veto took place, and it was not overridden---so while the likelihood of total vetoes and of overrides are both low, neither can be completely discarded. This branch will therefore not be practicable when there is no way to fully discard the possibility of a veto override. The dashed line in Figure \ref{F:game} indicates that the branch may or may not be part of the president's choice set. We analyze versions of the game with and without the dashed line.

Model analysis is analogous to \citet{dion.huber.1996}. The game has a unique, sub-game perfect equilibrium that we do not derive formally here.\footnote{Equilibrium is akin to \citet{magar.nd,romer.rosenthal.1978,cox.mccubbins.2005,gerber.1996}. We elaborate the bargaining logic with the example in Figure \ref{F:example}. The points $P$, $C$, and $F$ on the line represent the ideal points of the president, the committee, and the floor median, respectively, while $q$ is the status quo. We assume Euclidean single-peaked and symmetric preferences, so $F_q$ is the symmetric reflection of $q$ on the unidimensional line using $F$ as mirror, i.e, it is the floor median's point of indifference given the location of the status quo. Other relevant reflections are noted likewise; some appear in gray and will be relevant later. Given the model's assumptions, preferred sets are easily gauged: the floor median finds policy under the larger dashed pyramid ($x_C \in [q,F_q]$) preferable to the status quo; likewise, the president prefers policy under the smaller pyramid ($x_C \in [q,P_q]$) to the status quo. 

Deriving optimal proposal and consideration regime is trivial. Proceeding backwards in the game tree, the floor will accept proposals under the larger pyramid, reject the rest. So everyone anticipates that urgent consideration of proposal $x_C \in [q,F_q]$ beats the status quo. Also, because in the example $F$ is outside the smaller pyramid, all anticipate that the president discards standard consideration ($x_F=F$ would be the outcome). Therefore, in the example the committee can afford to send $x_C=C$. The President declares the bill urgent because it prefers the committee version of the bill to the floor one.

We now derive empirical implications from our theoretical model by generalizing the bargaining logic across preference profiles in Figure \ref{F:predictions} and do comparative statics analysis. A preference profile is an ordering of players' ideal points in space. Only three of six mutually-exclusive and exhaustive profiles are portrayed: $P<C<F$, $C \leq P \leq F$, and $C<F<P$ (the other three are mirror-images). In each, the status quo is treated as a continuous variable $q \in [0,1]$. We aim to trace how changes in $q$ affect equilibrium elements---the proposal, the consideration regime, and the outcome---in each profile.

The example discussed falls under profile I (the status quo falls where $P_C \leq q < P$). The equilibrium proposal and consideration regime discussed above, and the equilibrium outcome are listed accordingly. The discrete zones into which the policy space subdivides (the dark-gray, light-gray, and white rectangles) isolate status quos with unchanging equilibrium elements. One or more equilibrium elements mutate for status quos falling in the adjacent zone(s).

Our main question is under which conditions a bill will become urgent?  In other words, when will the president decide to assign the "urgency" title to a bill?  We pay attention to consideration regimes: in equilibrium, status quos in dark-gray zones trigger urgent consideration, and those in white zones trigger standard consideration. Status quos in light-gray zones lack a consideration regime because they push the committee to defend the status quo by withholding the bill (gate-keeping). Aided by auxiliary assumptions, empirical implications follow from comparative statics; we discuss three. To start, note that dark-gray zones predominate in Figure \ref{F:predictions} over the light-gray and white. Urgent status corresponds to dark-gray, and the first theoretical prediction follows:

\begin{description}
  \item [Hypothesis 1] Other things constant, urgent bill consideration is more likely than standard bill consideration. 
\end{description}
    
\noindent The supporting auxiliary assumptions are two: (1) a stochastic status quo with uniform probability density in $[0,1]$, and (2) preference profiles I, II, and III in the Figure are equiprobable. Auxiliary assumption can be relaxed, within limits, without invalidating this prediction. 

Also plain in the Figure is that white areas, corresponding to standard bill consideration, occur under profile III only. The president's and the committee's ideal points stand on either side of the floor median in profile III, but on the same side in I and II. If these conditions are readily visible in theory, preference unobservability is an obstacle towards a test. Auxiliary assumptions therefore need discussion before putting a hypothesis forth: (1) chairs are dictators in their committee's jurisdiction; and (2) party determines ideal points. The first auxiliary assumption sets procedure in such way that the committee can be construed as a unitary actor. The second associates player preferences to something observable: parties. Both assumptions corresponds to what happens in Chile. First, the committee chair has strong agenda-setting prerogatives. Second, political parties are highly disciplined, voting with the coalitions they belong to most of the time.
The next theoretical prediction follows. 

\begin{description}
  \item [Hypothesis 2.a] Other things constant, standard bill consideration does not occur when the chair of the reporting committee belongs to the president's party. 
\end{description}

\noindent Given well-documented presidential coalition discipline in Chile \citep{aleman.saiegh.coalUnityChile.2007,carey.2002}, we replace `party' by `coalition' as measure of preferences for an alternative. 

\begin{description}
  \item [Hypothesis 2.b] Other things constant, standard bill consideration does not occur when the chair of the reporting committee belongs to the president's coalition. 
\end{description}

For the next implication, see what happens when the distance separating $C$ and $P$ remains fixed while the distance between $C$ and $F$ shrinks. The size of the gate-keeping light-gray zone either remains unchanged (in Figure \ref{F:predictions}'s top panel) or also shrinks (in the remainder). The latter is quite plain in the second to next-to-last panels, where $F$ sets the upper limit of the light-gray zone. In the bottom panel, $F$ is within the light-gray zone, but its symmetric projection $C_F$ is the lower limit: sliding $F$ towards $C$ achieves the same, sliding $C_F$ towards $C$ does too. This projection game in the top panel involves both $P_F$ and $C_{p_F}$, sliding symmetrically in opposite directions to leave the size of the light-gray area unchanged. Reliance on similar auxiliary assumptions generates the next theoretical prediction.

\begin{description}
  \item [Hypothesis 3] Other things constant, the likelihood of gate-keeping is never larger when the bill's reporting committee chair belongs to to the president's coalition than to the opposition. 
\end{description}

\section{Data and urgency degrees}

To test Chilean urgency authority hypotheses, we collected original data between 1998 and 2014.\footnote{The Cámara de Diputados' web page (\url{www.camara.cl}) was scraped in November 2014 to retrieve the record (\emph{boletín}) of every proposal made between 11 March 1998 and 10 March 2014, inclusive.} We compiled information on every bill introduced in Congress between 11 March 1998 and 10 March 2014: who introduced the bill, when, in which chamber, the issue it deals with, its status at the time of consultation, and so forth. We also gathered information on the chronological detail of the bill's legislative process in the House: committee referrals and reports, floor discussion and voting, navette to the Senate, and more. Of direct relevance, we coded all urgency messages received by the Cámara. Table \ref{T:billDescriptives} offers a general summary of bill introduction, passage, and urgency incidence.

%\vp{Sacaría lo siguiente: Queries had been sent to congressional staff in October 2014 about the existence of an official API or FTP site where this well-structured data could be downloaded en bloc. There was no response. An automated script was then prepared to retrieve the information directly. The Cámara's web page is JavaScript-rich, an obstacle surmounted with \texttt{Python}'s Selenium library, putting together the bits and pieces of the scraping process. PERO VERIFICAR QUE LO QUE SIGUE ESTE EN LA FOOTNOTE "A commented version... HASTA ... of an earlier presidency)."} A commented version of the script and the data-set will be posted online upon publication. Data analysis was done with a multiplicity of \texttt{R}'s libraries.} Earlier years antedate Internet publication and were dropped, as data completeness in the primary source remains to be verified. The period selected fully covers two Senates, four Cámaras, and three presidencies (plus the last two years of an earlier presidency).

The executive sent 1,461 bills to Congress between 1998 and 2014, ninety-one yearly on average. Executive bills represented about one in five proposals in the period (members of Congress proposed 79 percent of all bills, not analyzed). More than one thousand proposals became law, putting the executive's success rate at 72 percent---high by Latin American standards \citep{morgenstern.nacif.2002}. And 834 bills became urgent during lower chamber consideration, more than half of all (57 percent). The relative term, which echoes Siavelis' finding for an earlier period, attests to the permissive notion of `urgency' by Chilean presidents. 

A feature of importance for our argument is the distinction among types of urgency by \emph{degree}. Although urgency authority is defined by the Constitution, Congress has distinguished urgency types through its internal rules. The congressional organic law gives the president the choice to designate urgencies of `one month' (\emph{urgencia simple} or 30 days), `two weeks' (\emph{urgencia suma} or 15 days), or `act now' (\emph{discusión inmediata} or 6 days).\footnote{See \emph{Ley Orgánica del Congreso}, arts.\ 26 and 27. Congressional practice is well summarized by the library of Congress at \url{http://www.bcn.cl/ecivica/formacion/}. Since the constitution, by defining `one month' urgency only, sets a floor for the authority, higher degrees in the organic law are therefore vulnerable to congressional majorities, who might be inclined to relax the deadlines available if that were in their interest---as, in fact, was done once. The organic law was amended in July 2010, four months into the newly elected legislature (and concurrent presidential administration), substantially relaxing the deadlines for the `act now' and `two week' urgencies, originally set at 10 and 3 days, to 15 and 6 days respectively. `One month' urgencies remained unchanged. But the Constitution (art.~66) also raises the bar for relaxing urgency deadlines by requiring the vote of four-sevenths ($\approx 57$ percent) of each chamber's membership for the passage and amendment of constitutional organic laws. While this qualified requirement is below the two-thirds needed for constitutional reform, no coalition has exceeded the organic law threshold in both chambers since the return to democracy.} Part B in Table \ref{T:billDescriptives} reports urgency frequencies by type.

\vp{We have to decide how to refer to urgencies. Right now we use different forms and in particular, I feel urgency ``messages'' may be confusing. I would delete the message wording altogether, and refer to urgencies or bills denoted/marked urgent --que en chile eso se haga mediante un instrumento que se llama mensaje es trivial, y de hecho a las iniciativas de ley del presidente también se las llama ``mensajes'', asi que esto podría resultar muy confuso para el lector}

Bills can be urgent more than once. We do not refer to the possibility that a bill is designated urgent during lower chamber consideration, then again during Senate consideration (analysis, in fact, ignores upper chamber urgency); but to the fact that, during Cámara consideration, one same bill often received many urgency designations---e.g., an initial one month deadline is reset before its expiration, or replaced by two weeks.\footnote{The modal urgent bill in the period received several such designations, sometimes renewing an urgency that was previously withdrawn. Other times the deadline for consideration was reset before the original expired, often more than once. Less common were cases changing one deadline by a shorter one. We plan to investigate the puzzling patterns of urgency chains in a separate project.} Urgency chains imply that the absolute frequencies by types do not add up to the total in panel III. Least frequent were bills with one `act now' deadline at least, 17 percent of all. Most frequent were those with at least one `two week' deadline, more than double the latter at 37 percent. Bills with `one month' deadlines were somewhere in between, at 29 percent.

We devote attention to urgency degrees because they are consequential. Degrees matter because they relate to bill passage. \citeauthor{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009}'s \citeyearpar{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009} study of executive success in Congress in three post-transition presidencies finds some of the evidence sought by \citet{siavelis.2002}. Controlling for relevant features (such as the bill's policy domain, the government's seat margin, or the presidential agenda size), urgency degrees had quite different effects on success rates. Higher degrees strongly and significantly associate with higher probability of executive success, while the lower made no statistical difference. Since low-degree urgencies were also quite prevalent, conflating them with the rest washed off the effect of the higher-degree in Siavelis' analysis. 

%The president may remove urgency at will, with immediate effects. With the exception of messages to the conference, the deadline is for the receiving chamber only, and urgency messages expire at the end of the ordinary period on March 10th every year.

Degrees also matter because higher ones trigger restrictive floor consideration rules, whereas the lowest degree does not. For this reason, and unless otherwise noted, by ``urgency'' in this paper we mean `act now' and `two week' deadlines only, the types that are consequential for our argument (the closed rule is not applicable to `one month' deadlines, see the appendix). As panel VII of Table \ref{T:billDescriptives} reports, 47 percent of the bills that the executive initiated received one such urgency at least. 

%\ges{The act now urgency are the ones that function as closed rule, or which ones??? also, where is the close rule mechanism? in the rules? I'll check the chapter by Soto. here we really need to write a bit about the rule that makes this urgency work as a close rule}
%\emm{Both act-now and two-week notices act as closed rules, but not one-month. See new appendix.}

\section{Urgency predictors}

A systematic analysis of data in Table \ref{T:billDescriptives} is revealing. The units are individual executive proposals: the dependent variable \emph{Urgent bill} equals 1 for proposals declared urgent while in the cámara, 0 otherwise. It excludes `one month' deadlines, which do not trigger the closed rule, and urgencies declared when the bill was in the Senate. Multivariate analysis controls for preference coincidence between the president and the reporting committee, for bill features, for timing, and for the strategic environment. Formal variable definitions and descriptive statistics appear in the appendix.

The preference group includes two regressors. The first has two alternative specifications: \emph{Co-partisan comm.\ chair}, equal 1 if the bill was referred to a standing committee presided by a member of the president's party, 0 otherwise; or \emph{Coalition comm.\ chair}, equal 1 for bills referred to committees chaired by members of any party in the presidential coalition, 0 otherwise. This is our key explanatory variable, measuring spatial proximity between the chief executive and the reporting committee. Other things constant, we expect the variable to associate positively with the dependent variable under both specifications (hypotheses 2.a and 2.b). Table \ref{T:chairsSeats} shows, in part A, that standing committee chairs from the president's party varied in the period, from a high of 53 percent in the 1998--2002 Legislatura to a low of 17 percent in 2006--10. And the opposition chaired no standing committee in 2006--10 only, but up to 24 and 27 percent in 2002--06 and 2010--14, respectively.\footnote{\emph{Largesse} towards opposition parties was probably aimed at beefing up the president's legislative support. The Table's parts B and C report variance in the size and status of the president's coalition in Congress. Given electoral list voting unity since the return to democracy \citep{carey.2002,aleman.saiegh.coalUnityChile.2007}, the seats they control are a good indicator of the executive's legislative support. The coalition remained in control of the Cámara throughout the period, but controlled Senate majorities between 2006 and 2010 only (coinciding with the first Bachelet administration). By requiring 67, 60, and 57 percent votes of each chamber, respectively, constitutional reform, constitution-interpreting legislation, and organic laws therefore always required support across the aisle.}

Then there is a control for multiple referrals. Nearly one quarter (24 percent) of bills in the period were referred to more than one standing committee. The `other committee' count excludes the Finance committee, with jurisdiction over any form of new spending (and discussed next; multiple referrals rise to 32 percent when the Finance committee is considered). Also excluded are special and bicameral committees. A single co-partisan or coalition chair among multiple referees suffices for the indicator previously discussed to equal 1, so we include dummy \emph{Multiple referrals} in the right side. It should capture any effect of agenda control sharing among several committee chairs in the proposal's negotiation. 

The bill features group consists of \emph{Hacienda referral}, equal 1 for bills referred to the powerful Finance committee, 0 otherwise. The Hacienda committee has special status in the Chilean Congress and deserves a separate control. Unlike other standing committees, it has jurisdiction over \emph{every} bill authorizing spending in any domain. Moreover, the unanimous exception rule discussed earlier is inapplicable to Hacienda bills, which \emph{must} be reported prior to floor consideration.\footnote{Standing rules (Ley orgánica del Congreso) arts.\ 17 and 21.} So, for instance, a proposal restricting labor benefits to municipal health workers was referred to both the Public Health and Hacienda committees because a small appropriation for verification by the Labor Bureau was \todo{Find another bill to illustrate... can't find date and other elements of the mentioned law} required. Hacienda committee members, working in tandem with Finance Ministry staff, may or may not appropriate funds from the budget in their report to the floor \citep{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009}. Not unlike the Appropriations and Rules committees in the U.S.\ House, Hacienda has the status of a control committee, a key asset for agenda power \citep{kiewiet.mccubbins.1991}. Hacienda referral therefore controls for a subset of generally important proposals, and should associate positively with urgency authority. %Next is \emph{Member bill}, equal 1 for legislator proposals (\emph{mociones}), 0 for executive proposals (\emph{mensajes}). The strong negative bi-variate association of the proposing branch and urgency authority should remain when other factors are held constant. %An alternative specification of this variable consists of three separate dummies instead of one, with more precise control: \emph{Member bill, pres.~coal.-sp.} indicates legislator proposals with presidential coalition sponsors only (i.e., the sole sponsor or all co-sponsors belong to parties in the president's coalition at initiation), \emph{Member bill, opp.-sp.} those with opposition sponsors only, and \emph{Member bill, mix-sp.} those with a mixture of both. 

The strategic environment group includes three controls. \emph{Pres.~approval} is the net presidential approval at bill initiation (i.e., the percentage who approve of the president's job minus the percentage who disapprove).\footnote{Data are from the Centro de Estudios Públicos bi-yearly face-to-face opinion polls, available at \url{www.cepchile.cl}.} To the extent that presidents with higher public opinion rating are, other things constant, more successful in the legislative arena \citep{bond.fleisher.1990,aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009}, they should also need urgency authority less often, and reliance might therefore drop. \emph{Introduced in Senate} equals 1 for bills initiated in the upper chamber, 0 otherwise. By virtue of being smaller, enjoying longer terms, and not being firmly in the president's coalition control during most of the period, bills sent or initiated in the Senate might present systematic differences in urgency usage. And \emph{Senate majority} equals 1 if the president's coalition controlled half or more of upper chamber seats when the bill was initiated, 0 otherwise.\footnote{Parties in the presidential and opposition coalitions were tied throughout most of the 1998--2006 Senate (majority briefly oscillating back and forth in the first years due to member indictments, impeachments, and deaths in both coalitions). Ties are coded as \emph{Senate majority} = 1.} Other things equal, presidents with sufficient partisan legislative resources in both chambers will find it easier to push proposals through Congress, and might be less inclined to use urgency to successfully navigate log-rolls through the plenary session.

The timing group controls for the congressional cycle. \emph{Year remaining} (and its squared value to capture non-linearity, if any) measures the percentage of legislative year remaining at bill initiation. Chilean legislative years begin after the (meridional) Summer break. So the variable adopts value 100 for proposals introduced on March 1 (the first day of the legislative year), and value 0 for proposals introduced the last day of February. It should control for stationarity in the data. And \emph{Relax deadlines} equals 1 for bills initiated in July 2010 or later, 0 otherwise. Any systematic shift in urgency usage attributable to the reform extending deadlines of high-degree notices five months into the 2010--14 Legislature should reflect in this coefficient. 

%With presidential terms cut from six to four years in length starting in 2006, the Bachelet (2006--10) and Piñera (2010--14) terms were both perfectly coincident with concurrently elected Cámara's term. But the end of the Frei (from 1998 to 2000) and beginning of the Lagos (from 2000 to 2002) terms, however, overlapped a common Legislature, providing leverage to separate effects, if any, of the legistative and executive electoral timetables on urgency. The temporal trends in the longitudinal urgency incidence plots are so distinctive that they should remain significant when other factors are controlled. 

Given that observations from four elected Legislaturas, with important differences in the types and the volume of proposals considered \citep{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009} are pooled, heterogeneity might interfere. So we fit two additional model specifications for robustness verification. One includes fixed Legislatura effects---i.e., three dummies for bills initiated in the 2002--06, 2006--10, and 2010--14 periods, respectively; the excluded 1998--2002 dummy is the baseline. Another adds further flexibility by also estimating separate errors for bills initiated in in each Legislatura \citep[a so-called mixed effects model,][:262,302]{gelman.hill.2007}. Estimation is with a generalized linear model for the mixed effects fit, and logit for the rest. We normalized continuous variables \emph{Pres.~approval} and \emph{Year remaining} to speed the GLM's convergence.\footnote{As suggested in \url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23478792/warning-messages-when-trying-to-run-glmer-in-r} and \url{https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/33653_57fc7b8e5d484c909b615d8633c01d51.html}. Normalization re-scales and centers the measures in order to improve parameter identification.} Normalized measures were used throughout for model comparability.

%\emm{New model, includes executive bills only. Excludes urgency messages in Senate (previously conflated with Cámara urgencias). Could report member bills model in the appendix (coalition chair doesn't work, but co-partisan does!), but adds little to our argument---urgent member bills seem to respond to a different logic.}

Table \ref{t:urgenLogit} reports results.\footnote{Models fitted with \texttt{R} base's \texttt{glm} and library \texttt{lme4}'s \citep{lme4.2015}.} The regression model performs satisfactorily. A likelihood-ratio test of overall fit rejects the hypothesis, at below the .001 level, that an intercept-only fit is as good as our models. Predictors across model specifications correctly classify 90 percent of the observations. Coefficient estimates confirm that, controlling other factors in the model, \emph{Co-partisan comm.~chair} has a positive coefficient in model 1, as expected. The effect achieves conventional statistical significance (parentheses in the table report p-values, below the .01 level here). The evidence is much stronger for the variable's other specification. The coefficient for \emph{Coalition comm.~chair} in models 2--4 is also positive, more than triples in size, and achieves p-values below .001. As scholars have documented, the coalition is as good a predictor of presidential support in Congress---or better, in our case---as the party. The finding is robust across model specifications. In general, all model coefficients remain pretty much unchanged in size and significance when fixed and mixed effects are included in the right side (we are forced to drop variables \emph{Senate majority} and \emph{Relax deadlines} due to co-linearity with Legislatura dummies).

    \caption{Average marginal effects from model 3. Dots report how the probability of an urgent bill changes in response to a unit change in each independent variable, all else at mean values; bars are 95-percent confidence intervals.}\label{F:avgMg}
    \includegraphics[width=.8\columnwidth]{../graphs/avgMgEffects.pdf}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{F:avgMg} reports changes in the average predicted probability of an urgent bill associated with unit changes in model 3's explanatory variables (all other regressors at their mean value). This is a convenient way to gauge logit regression coefficients by translating them into interpretable quantities. A report from a committee with a coalition chair experiences a .23 hike (and a .06 standard error) in the likelihood of getting a closed rule in the floor compared to a report by an opposition-chaired committee. The effect is nearly as big as the average marginal effects of \emph{Hacienda referral} (.26), and double that of \emph{Multiple referrals} (.12), two regressors with substantive effects. We find no statistical evidence to reject our Hypothesis 2.  

The large effects of Hacienda and multiple referrals deserves comment. When spending gets in the way in Chile, restrictive rules are the norm. Recall that multiple referrals exclude the finance committee, so there is an independent effect of bills with jurisdictional overlaps worth investigating further. And the finance committee was always chaired by a coalition member but, with the exception of the 1998 to 2000 period, never by a co-partisan of the president. This may explain the milder effect of the partisan specification of our key variable in model 1. 

%Two alternative specifications ... With the exception of \emph{Senate minority}, gaining in size and achieving .1-level significance, estimate changes are negligible. The change attests that the 2010--14 Legislature, with presidential minority status throughout (the 1998--2002 had short lapses only) experienced bigger inter-chamber differences in urgency incidence. The simpler urgency models are quite robust. 

%The strategic environment controls get mixed results. Neither coefficient for \emph{Pres.~Approval} nor \emph{Senate minority} achieved statistical significance. But \emph{Introduced in Senate} did. Bills successfully passing the upper chamber before moving to the Cámara were likelier to get urgent status, and the effect is significant at the .006 level. Proposals initiated in the Senate, where the opposition was systematically larger (and at times controlled the chamber) were, other things constant, also likelier urgency targets. Note also this coefficient's sizable hike from model 1 to model 2, gaining about a third in size while other coefficients did not change when controls for member-bill sponsorship are added. The lower initiation of mix-member bills in the Senate, as opposed to the Cámara (a $-.34$ correlation between \emph{Introduced in Senate} and \emph{Member bill, mix-sponsored}) masks a portion of the effect when sponsorship controls are omitted. 

%Both time trend variables returned significant coefficients. Other things constant, bills were likelier to become urgent earlier in the term and earlier in the legislative year. The apparent contradiction of the patterns in Figure \ref{f:depvarHistog} is explained by the distinction of non-original urgency messages---where most of the temporal trend is manifest---which is disregarded by the dichotomous measure of urgency analyzed here. 

Another control worth highlighting is \emph{Introd.\ in Senate}. Bills successfully passing the upper chamber first, where the opposition was systematically larger and at times in control were, other things constant, much less likely to get urgent status (the average marginal effect is $-.16$ and significant). Future research should pay attention to inter-cameral negotiation, in general, and the reliance on urgency in the upper chamber, in particular. In any event, our results indicate that agreements and compromises reached to in the Senate required less, not more, protection from floor amendments in the Cámara's plenary.

\end{figure}

Finally, there are time trends in urgency authority usage that simulations reveal neatly. Figure \ref{F:sims} portrays the predicted probability that a bill gets urgent status throughout the legislative year. Regressors in model 3 are held constant to simulate a bill sent to the Cámara in the 2010--14 Legislature and referred to Hacienda and just one standing committee. The president's approval (insignificant across models) is set to the median value in the period. The inverted-U shape shows how urgency probability, predicted at .2 for coalition-chaired committees at the start, and .075 for the rest, becomes much likelier in the first half of the legislative year. By the second quarter (June--August), the probability is at its maximum, about .37 percent and .16, respectively. It then experiences a sharp drop, ending the austral Summer break at .16 for coalition-chaired committees, and .05 for others. And the gap between the 95-percent confidence bands of the predictions is quite plain, giving confidence that we are picking up a signal and not just random noise. 

\section{Discussion}

Since the late Nineteenth Century, restrictive rules are the domain of the Rules committee in the U.S.\ House \citep{denhartog.2004phd,cox.mccubbins.2005,sin.2014}. However, it is the president who has possession of this key legislative prerogative in Chile. The executive branch decides which bills go to the floor with a closed rule. 

In this paper we elaborated some implications of this peculiar, inter-branch institutional arrangement. Theoretically, we found that when the committee chair's preferences are closer to those of the President, then the probabilities that bills will be labeled as urgent increases. That is, committee chairs negotiate directly with the president the bill they want to see enacted.  When this is the case, the President imposes a closed rule on it, and the bill is not modified in the floor.  In other words, this institutional tool increases cooperation between branches. Committee chair and President commit to a deal that cannot be undone because it is protected by an urgent label.


\emm{Convendrá elaborar la relevancia de que la retrictive rule esté en manos del presidente. ¿Por qué no retienen esa facultad los legisladores?}

%% McCox 2nd Ed leviathan, fn 5 p. 214: ``Congressional Quarterly (1994 <-- 19nov, 3326) describes the role played by the modern Rules committee: The Rules committee is the gatekeeper to the House floor. It has a unique role and function, determining how and whether a major bill will be considered on the floor, and which amendments and motions will be allowed. This gives the committee considerable power in shaping the legislative agenda and makes it the arbiter of frequent turf fights between other committees.''  



%Yet inspection of recent urgency message incidence reveals a strikingly high frequency: one of every five bills in Congress received some form of executive urgency at some stage (and often at several stages) of the legislative process; and more than two-thirds of executive proposals did. Adding a layer to the puzzle, Congress in fact complied with a significant number of urgency messages. Why would presidents resort so remarkably frequently to the institutionally inconsequential urgency authority? And why would legislators comply so often with empty executive threats?

\subsection{Act-now and two-week urgencies}

The cámara's standing rules explicitly preclude the second committee report for bills tagged with a two-week or an act-now urgency, and rule out the bill's second reading by mandating that ``general'' (i.e., first reading) and ``particular'' (i.e., second reading) consideration take place simultaneously.

%% \section{The received wisdom}

%% \begin{center}
%% \singlespacing
%% [U]rgency powers... can have dramatic effects on executive-legislative \\ 
%% relations, legislative organization, and the policy process more generally\\ 
%% ---\citet[][:438]{morgenstern.2002b}
%% \end{center}
%% \onehalfspacing

%% %\citeauthor{carey.shugart.1998a}'s \citeyearpar{carey.shugart.1998a} monograph on executive unilateral powers does not discuss it. \citeauthor{londregan.2000a}'s \citeyearpar{londregan.2000a} study of legislative institutions in the Chilean Senate does not include urgency authority in the index. 

%% \noindent Scholars have paid little attention to urgency authority. \citeauthor{shugart.carey.1992}'s \citeyearpar{shugart.carey.1992} seminal monograph does not include it when computing the index of presidents' legislative powers. And while not addressing it directly either, \citeauthor{carey.shugart.1998a}'s \citeyearpar{carey.shugart.1998a} discussion of the delegation of unilateral authority to the executive offers clues of the logic behind the institution. Informational and valence asymmetries between Latin American executive and legislative branches create incentives for such delegation. Delays to reach agreement in assemblies offer further incentives by diminishing the value of policy \citep{baron.ferejohn.1989}, so rather than delegate proposal power within the chamber, legislators may find it preferable to let the president set the agenda. 

%% %\citet{siavelis.2002} is the first study to cover urgency authority. He hypothesized urgencies' game-changer potential. His study of Chilean executive-legislative covers the first post-transition presidency revealed just how very frequently urgency messages were issued: slightly more than one-third of proposals in Congress received some form of urgency, and about 9 out of 10 of urgent bills were executive-initiated. Guided by semantics, analysis sought to discover if urgent bills, in fact, circulated the steps of the legislative process faster than the rest, and whether urgency status also increased the likelihood of bill passage. The study found mixed evidence. Among executive bills, consideration of urgent ones had somewhat shorter duration than the rest (medians of 134 and 160 days, respectively), but no palpable difference in success rates is appreciated (64 and 63 percent, respectively). 

%% \citet{siavelis.2002} is the only systematic study of urgency authority we are aware of. Like Morgenstern's quote, he hypothesized urgency power's game-changer potential. His study of Chilean executive-legislative in the first post-transition administration revealed the amazing frequency with which urgency messages were issued by President Aylwin: slightly more than one-third of proposals in Congress received some form of urgency, and about 9 out of 10 of urgent bills were executive-initiated. Guided by semantics, he also sought to discover if ``urgent'' bills, in fact, circulated the steps of the legislative process faster than the rest, and whether urgency status increased the likelihood of bill passage. The study found mixed evidence at best. Among executive bills, consideration of those urgent had somewhat shorter duration than the rest (medians of 134 and 160 days, respectively), but no palpable difference in success rates is appreciated (64 and 63 percent, respectively). 

%% The negative finding may bear relation to three elements. In their study of budgetary congressional oversight of the executive, \citet{berrios.gamboa.fiscChile.2006} warn against overstating the Chilean urgency authority's importance, as non-compliance entails no penalty for Congress---the next section develops this argument. While this may explain the lack of effects, it begs the question of why the president resorted so frequently to an authority that seems inconsequential. In other words, why make so many empty threats?

%% Another is a failure to control for urgency degrees---elaborated in section 3---in the analysis. \citeauthor{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009}'s \citeyearpar{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009} systematic study of executive success in Congress in three post-transition presidencies finds some of the evidence sought by Siavelis. Controlling for bill characteristics (such as key policy domains, the chamber where the bill originated, the government's seat margin, and presidential agenda size), urgency degrees had quite different effects in passage. Higher degrees significantly associate with better probability of executive success, but the lower made no statistical difference. Since, as will be seen, low-degree urgencies were much more prevalent, conflating them washes off the effect of the higher-degree. 

%% % longer review of aleman and navia
%% %\citeauthor{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009}'s \citeyearpar{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009} systematic study of executive success in Congress in three post-transition presidencies also inspects Chile's urgency authority. Among controls, their equation includes urgency authority usage in the right side. The unit is the individual bill, and the size of the executive agenda varies substantially over the years. Variation is quantitative  (Congress received about 150 presidential bills in each of the first 6 years after 1990, a numbrer that dropped to about 70 in the next 6 years, then climbed to about 100 in the final 4 years of their series) and qualitative, presidents manifesting different propensities to aim at constitutional reform. Of direct relevance are the findings on urgencies. Controlling for key policy domains, chamber of origin, seat margins, and presidential approval, and clustering errors by legislative year, different prioritization reveal quite different effects in passage. `Act now' and `2-week' notices significantly increased the probability of bill passage, but not `one month' notices. 

%% Finally, selection bias is an obstacle to measure urgency authority effects. Presidents, behaving strategically, are likely to target for urgency proposals that are markedly different from the rest in important ways, so the set of bills receiveing urgent status is not random. Like the Siavelis and Alemán-Navia studies, we recognize the endogeneity problem that arises but does not confront it methodologically. Until a more subtle identification design is proposed, findings must be taken with a grain of salt. The systematic study of urgency authority in Chile that follows should contribute to pave the way to a solution. 

%% %If presidents, behaving strategically, were to target for urgency proposals that are markedly different from the rest in important ways, a problem of endogeneity arises. Classify proposals based on how difficult passage is expected: easy, hard, and impossible. If left on their own, the easy proposals would be approved faster, the hard slower, the impossible never. A strategic president should concentrate urgency authority in the hard group, leaving easy proposals mostly on their own, while abandoning the hopeless group of impossible proposals, that will not be observed. As a consequence, comparing

%% %The relevant quantity of interest is whether the use of urgency authority affects bill passage (success, speed, amendments, and so forth) compared to the same bill with no urgency attached. The fundamental problem of causal inference is immediately evident. The executive presumably targets bills for urgency strategically, so that the selection mechanism cannot be assumed random. If, for example, more complex and divisive legislation takes longer, is likelier to fail and likelier to be tagged urgent, separating effects requires more subtle methods than used up to now.


%% \section{Variable urgency degrees}
%% \begin{center}
%% Presidential power is the power to persuade ---Neustadt\footnote{\citet[][:11]{neustadt.1990}}
%% \end{center}


%% Vagueness surrounds key aspects of urgency authority. When a 30-day limit is set, for instance, no indication is given of whether those are calendar, business, or session days. I treat the messages in weeks rather than days given imprecision (and, when coding deadlines in the empirical sections below, rely on business days, as \citet[][:285]{sotoCongChile2015} suggests). More important, no formal reversionary course of action is defined, and no hint of rulings by the Constitutional Tribunal filling in the institutional void could be found. As seen in the previous section, I interpret indeterminacy as reversion to the status quo with no effect on the voting schedule.


%% %Urgency type frequency, in fact, reveals a tendency to rely less often on more urgent messages (descriptive data is presented in the next section). `Act now' notices were roughly 3 to 5 times less frequent than `two week' ones in a recent 16-year period. The frequency differential between `two week' and `one month' notices is less sharp, but a tendency is distinguishable.

%% % \end{center}
%% % \end{table}

%% % Other interesting patterns in urgency authority usage are discernible in bill histories. Assessing how large the subset of bills receiving one or more urgency messages is conveys a minimalist perspective of urgency authority. As shown in table \ref{T:billFreqByNurg}, most bills in this subset (84 percent) in fact received many such messages, and a substantial portion (40 percent) received between 6 and 71 urgency messages. This raises another puzzle for research. Are presidents reiterating urgency messages because of Congressional inaction? Extending the deadline may help the president save face when legislative non-compliance is imminent. Or are presidents micro-managing select-bill consideration in committee, monitoring a report's progress and then sending recommendations in the message extending the deadline? The source indicates the arrival of presidential messages but does not include their actual contents, nor those of committee reports. Archival research to retrieve those documents would do wonders in answering these questions. 

%% %A bicameral process operating on a single-round navette \citep{tsebelis.money.1997}---bills migrate from originating to revising chamber, back to originating if amended, and finally to conference if inter-cameral differences persist---offers, at most, four clear instances for repeated urgency authority use. Yet, as table \ref{T:billFreqByNurg} reports, nearly half of urgent bills (47 percent) received five messages or more. A handful of bills received several dozen messages!

%% Chains offer a better perspective of the evolution of urgency usage than sheer messages. The 170 percent message surge between the 2002--06 and 2006--10 Legislatures was, in fact, due to declaring 90 percent more legislation urgent, the rest attributable to substantially longer chains (4.2 links on average, up from 3). The 2010--14 hike is mostly due to longer chains (4.7 links on average), as the chain frequency increase was negligible. Plotting weekly urgency messages in the period, as Figure \ref{f:depvarHistog} does, reveals how original urgency incidence changed little over the years, unlike non-original message incidence. Each panel in the figure (one of which is zoomed above to provide detail) reports one legislative year as two super-imposed histograms, one for Cámara and one for Senate messages (both positive scales, red asterisks marking off-the-chart counts). The black portion of columns count original urgency messages, the gray count deadline changes and withdrawals. Note how black central segments had some tendency to grow in both chambers from year to year. But that change looks minute compared to how the gray fringes expanded. Urgency-wise, Presidents Bachelet (2006--10) and Piñera (2010--14) had relatively quiet first years in office, using the authority much more often after the second, and especially after the third year. Piñera's more insistent messages to the Senate than the Cámara, as seen in the red star asymmetry, coincided with a lack of majority in the chamber.

%% % ``Para evitar entorpecer el funcionamiento de Congreso, el Ejecutivo procura no tener, al mismo tiempo, más de 10 proyectos con urgencia en cada una de las Cámaras (entrevista Carmona)'' (fn.~25) Carmona citado en berrios gamboa

%% Also plain in figure \ref{f:depvarHistog} is the time scarcity problem. If urgency authority were consequential, the abundance of messages would pose a genuine scheduling problem for members and their legislative parties. Not taking the February Summer break into account (when Congress rarely convenes), the Cámara in the median legislative year had just 4 weeks free of original urgency messages, and none free of urgency messages of either type. Saturating the agenda with urgent executive bills inevitably plunders scheduling time to consider members' pet projects.\footnote{\citet{berrios.gamboa.fiscChile.2006} quote the executive's legal chief of staff describing a general goal in the Executive branch to have, at most, ten urgent projects in each chamber at once and thus ``prevent blundering congressional work (\emph{evitar entorpecer el funcionamiento de Congreso})'' (fn.~25). It is an optimistic assessment of presidential self-restraint, to say the least. If urgency authority were consequential, presidents who have taken the chamber's schedule hostage might be a better analogy than self-restraint.} The president may be taking the legislative schedule hostage \citep[cf.][]{cox.mccubbins.1994,williamson.1975}. In such circumstances, urgency authority is another asset for vote-buying, presidents freeing up scheduling time or even granting members' projects urgent status in exchange for support for difficult proposals. The evidencein table \ref{T:sponsorsOfUrgBills} is consistent with this conjecture: controlling for the percentage of signatures by legislators belonging to Concertación parties in the proposal reveals that presidents often granted urgent status to opposition bills. Of member bills declared urgent by Concertación presidents (1998--2010), 21 percent fell in this category, and 26 percent by the right-of-center administration that followed (2010--2014). This bonding perspective of scheduling is a promising line of research of executive-legislative negotiation. 

%% \section{Urgency chains}

%% Urgency authority predictors aide the interpretation of the next pieces of analysis. Units here are not individual bills but urgency instances, in search for correlates in the legislation they target. The previous section ignored urgency reiteration, a striking pattern in the data. This section isolates urgency chains in search for one observable consequences in the legislative process. If urgency authority were consequential, it should prompt action in the chamber where the bill awaited consideration. Moreover, the action should happen within the deadline established by the president. 

%% Several actions might follow an urgency call: the bill is marked in committee; one or more committee reports (called \emph{informes} in Chile) are drafted and adopted; the bill is reported, with possible revisions or even a negative advise, to the floor; a positively-reported bill is scheduled in the Order (\emph{Orden del Día}); the plenary considers, possibly amends, and eventually votes the bill's passage; and possibly others. Analysis here focuses on committee reports. Unlike some of the steps listed, reports are observable in the bill histories collected. If report contents are, unfortunately, unavailable in the data, the drafting committee(s) and report date(s) are included. Since urgency messages are also dated, synchronicity can be verified systematically.  

%% Committee reports are a good choice to search for urgency authority effects because only exceptional cases should not get one. Unless the floor votes an exception to the rules unanimously, every bill in Chile is referred to a standing or special committee upon first introduction to each chamber. Another exception are bills previously reported at the time the urgency call is made. A last exception are bills discharged from committee for direct floor consideration. No explicit discharge procedure could be found in the congressional standing orders, but presumably it is the same---unanimous consent---to consider a bill without prior committee referral. There is no record in the data to verify it, but the presumption is that such exceptions are rare. At any rate, exceptions play against detecting ripples caused by urgency authority.

%% One hypothesis of consequential urgency authority tested is that raising an urgency prompts a committee report. A finer hypothesis involves the chronology of events: if urgency authority were consequential, bill reporting should occur \emph{before} the given deadline expires. Because the terms of the urgency were modified so often in the period, chains---not individual messages---are considered for analysis, expecting reports on or before the chain's final deadline. Rejecting hypotheses weighs against consequential urgency authority, committees retaining the potential as formidable gatekeepers in their policy jurisdiction---failure to draft a report prevents the proposal from progressing in the legislative process \citep{cox.mccubbins.1993,fenno.1973,shepsle.weingast.1987}. 

%% %Due to the frequency with which deadlines are adjusted, expecting a timely reports for every message is unreasonable, even if the urgency authority were consequential. The relevant units are therefore not urgency messages but urgency chains: reports should antedate the final deadline set by a chain of messages. 

%% %This section analyzes bill histories to detect whether or not reports follow urgency messages in the Cámara de Diputados, and whether or not this occurs in a timely manner. Failure to observe the report is evidence of inconsequential urgency authority.  

%% As mentioned, the Hacienda committee has special status in the Chilean Congress and deserves attention. Unlike other committees, Hacienda has jurisdiction over \emph{every} bill authorizing spending in any domain. Moreover, the unanimous exception rule is inapplicable to Hacienda bills, which \emph{must} be reported to be considered in the floor.\footnote{Standing rules (Ley orgánica del Congreso) arts.\ 17 and 21.} So, for instance, a proposal restricting labor benefits to certain state health workers at the municipal level was referred to both the Public Health and Hacienda committees because a small appropriation for verification by the Labor Bureau was required. Hacienda committee members, working in tandem with Finance Ministry staff \citep{aleman.navia.UrgChi.2009}, may or may not appropriate funds from the budget in their report to the floor. Not unlike the Appropriations and Rules committees in the U.S.\ House, Hacienda has the status of a control committee, a key asset for agenda power \citep{kiewiet.mccubbins.1991}. Because Hacienda referral is mandatory, only previously reported bills would not get a Hacienda report following an urgency. 

%% The assessment of predictors of timely committee reports analyzes the subset of chains from bills that were referred to the Hacienda committee separately from the full set of chains in the period. The dependent variable equals 1 if a report (an Hacienda report in the chain subset) is observed on or before the deadline set by the final message in the chain (business days used for computation); equals 0 otherwise. The multivariate analysis includes predictors in the previous section (defined over chains instead of bills), minus Hacienda referral---a bill trait is controlled differently here---and presidential approval.\footnote{Including \emph{Pres.~approval} returns a statistically insignificant coefficient and produces negligible changes in other predictors.} Also in the right side are indicators for original urgency message types. \emph{2~week~notice} and \emph{1~month~notice} are mutually-exclusive dummies equal 1 if the first, or only, message in the chain is of the said type, respectively, and 0 otherwise. The omitted category are act now messages, which serve as baseline for coefficient interpretation. There are also indicators for reiterated messages. \emph{Change~deadline} equals 1 if at least one message extending or cutting short the original deadline is chained to the first urgency message; equals 0 otherwise. And \emph{Withdraw~urgency} equals 1 if the final message in a chain dropped the bill's urgent status; equals 0 otherwise. An alternative specification with 11 mutually-exclusive dummies (Act now singleton; Act now with deadline modified; Act now withdrawn; and so forth) yielded essentially identical results in a much less parsimonious equation.  

%% %The predictors used in the urgency models... \emph{Senate minority} and predictors listed below in Table \ref{t:chainsRegs}) are defined for chains instead of bills: Senate minority equals 1 if the opposition had majority status when the chain started and 0 otherwise; and so forth.

%% % need MCMC simulations: two plots with 4yrs in x-axis and prob(reportHda) in y-axis, one for member bills, the other for exec bills. Plot lines for act now, 2 week, 1 month, change, withdraw. 

%% The Hacienda specification in Table \ref{t:chainsRegs} is discussed first. Overall model performance is satisfactory, predicting correctly 81 percent of the chains observed. The null that predictors do no better than a constant-only estimation is rejected at a level orders of magnitude below .001 (not reported). And coefficient estimates offer an interesting perspective. Compared to act now messages, two week notices are likelier to trigger a timely Hacienda report, an effect significant at the .006 level. Given that multi-link chains are controlled separately, this effect is attributable to the original message only. So, other things constant, presidents improved the odds of Hacienda reporting the bill through singleton urgency chain by opting for two week notices instead of act now. One month notices, however, were no less successfull than act now messages in this respect (effects are statistically indistiguishable). Not surprisingly, changing the deadline had a positive and significant effect in the probability of observing a timely Hacienda report. Most deadline changes brought extra time for consideration, often adding several links to the chain, with palpably better odds of getting a report. Withdrawing the bill's urgent status did the same. 

%% Other things constant, member proposals are associated with higher likelihood of timely Hacienda reports than executive proposals contingent on the co-sponsoring profile. While all \emph{Member bill} coefficients are positive, only the opposition-only-sponsored are significant. Chains of member proposals were no less successfull in triggering report than presidential project chains, but opposition project chains experienced a substantial boost in the odds of a timely Hacienda report. That presidents chose opposition projects among a select group of member bills to target for urgency is remarkable, but the effect this had in their progress in the legislative process is even more remarkable (the biggest coefficient in the table, in fact). Presidents systematically rewarded some opposition members and their projects. Rewarding coalition members was possibly done by executive initiation of their pet projects.     

%% %And model 6, with controls for bill member sponsorship, reveals that the effect is fully attributable to opposition proposals, as the coefficients for bills sponsored in full or in part by presidential coalition members are statistically indistinguishable from zero. 

%% As in the urgency models, the presidential term and legislative year remaining regressors were normalized for the sake of the mixed effects estimation. Significant time trends are patent, urgency chains started earlier in the presidential term (and, non-sigificantly, earlier in each legislative year) getting timely Hacienda reports more probably, other things constant, than those started later. Urgency chains had significantly better odds of compelling timely Hacienda action in the Senate than in the Cámara, even if Senate opposition control of the Senate had no effect. This confirms inter-chamber differences hinted by the urgency models, presidents using the urgency authority not just more often but also with improved results in the upper than the lower. And unlike urgency models, the reform relaxing deadlines in 2010 had a significant effect (at the .1-level or better), the likelihood of timely reports \emph{dropping} with longer consideration periods. As the institutional change happened just months into the last Legislature and presidency in the dataset, with the opposition in fiorm control of the Senate and the first non-Concertación post-transition president, the effect is over-determined to jump to conclusions about it. 

%% Unlike the urgency models, the fixed and mixed effects specifications had no effect in Hacienda coefficients. (Only the loss of significance of the \emph{Relax deadlines} coefficient in model 6 is notable; but fully attributable to the high colinearity of the said variable with the 2010--14 fixed effect.) And analysis of the full set of chains in models 9--12 yields mostly similar estimates to the Hacienda chains. All points to model robustness, to different specifications but also to analysis of more numerous and less controlled data. The difference worth noting are coefficients of the \emph{Member bill} battery. Compared to chains of Hacienda-referred bills, those of among the full set of member bills in the period were significantly less likely to get a timely committee report than executive bills with the same status, although the least hurt among member bills were those sponsored by the opposition only. 

%% All said, there is statistical evidence that the urgency successfully puts the assembly in motion, at least in the form of producing committee reports before the deadline. And the timing of the movement appears systematically driven by the rhythm that presidents decide unilaterally. Regressions of weekly reports on lagged weekly urgency messages are a final complement to the findings.\footnote{The general form is $\mathit{nReports}_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathit{nUrgencies}_t + \beta_2 \mathit{nUrgencies}_{t-1} + ...$, where \emph{nReports} and \emph{nUrgencies} are weekly reports and urgencies observed, respectively; $t$ is the current week; $t-1$ the week before; and so forth, up to four lags. Also in the right side are controls (reported in the appendix only) for presidential approval, the percentage of the current legislative year remaining at week $t$, and a dummy distinguishing the 2010--2014 legislature from the 2006--2010 baseline.} Using messages instead of chains operates a raise of the bar, and also detects a signal. Analysis covers the 2006--2014 period (when chains became longer) in the Cámara only (where estimated urgency authority effects are milder in the previous models). As before, Hacienda and all committees regressions were produced. When counting weekly urgency messages, the right side makes a distinction of `act now', `two week', `one month' messages, and those imposing a shorter deadline than originally set. When a bill receives an `act now' notice, an effect should be observed almost immediately, in the current week or the next at most. Other urgency degree effects should not necessarily be so immediate.

%% \caption{Effect of weekly urgency messages on Cámara's committee reports, 2006--2014. Entries report sign and significance of selected regression coefficients. Negative binomial method of estimation.}\label{t:negbin}
%% \end{table}

%% Table \ref{t:negbin} is a synthesis of five model specifications, reporting just the signs and significance of key coefficients (full results in the appendix). Regressions taking executive and member bills' reports in the left side were fitted separately and appear in each of the table's columns. When regressing Hacienda reports, only messages targeting bills specifically referred to that Cámara committee were counted in the right side. So model 11 gauges the potential effect that raising urgency for Hacienda-referred executive bills has on Hacienda's reports of executive bills. Model 14 does the same for member bills. In order to investigate if executive bill urgency also has an effect on member bill reports---possibly delaying them, as the president obstructs the top scheduling slots---model 12 takes model 14's dependent variable but model 11's predictors. Models 15 and 16 seek how executive bill urgencies (regardless of referral) potentially affect reports (regardless of committee). Expectations are directional (urgencies should associate with reporting hikes) so one-tailed tests were used---double plus/minus signs indicate standard .05 significance; a single sign .1 significance; and no sign lack of statistical significance. 

%% Results are consistent with consequential urgency authority. Other things constant, `act now' messages in models 11, 14, and 15 grow in tandem with reports issued the very same week or the next (i.e., weeks 0 and 1). Urging immediate Hacienda committee action is followed quite immediately by above average Hacienda reports. And milder urgency associates with later increments in reporting, very clearly in model 11, less so in models 14 and 15. Week 2's negative sign in model 11 is also notable: a slump follows Hacienda's reporting surge. Once the obstruction is behind, time is not devoted to Hacienda-referred executive bills, but to something else---the item that the executive obstruction stopped, perhaps. And model 12 shows that messages urging Hacienda to schedule executive bills makes ripples in the committee's \emph{member}-bill reporting. `Act now' messages bring member-bill reporting up in week 1, `two week' messages see reporting up in weeks 0 and 2, down in week 1. This is not conclusive evidence, but it does suggest the Hacienda committee squeezes member proposals obstructed by the president's self-prioritizing before and immediately after urgent business is considered.

%% % Reiterating a message could be due to non-compliance: in light of congressional inaction on an urgent bill, the executive sends the message again, perhaps over and over again. The contents of many messages can be downloaded as separate files from the web, but this remains a route for future work. Yet an inspection of the types of messages observed in the period suggests otherwise.

%% % An urgency message can be sent at any stage of the bicameral legislative process, compelling the chamber receiving it to act on a bill. Since urgencies expire once the chamber has finished, it is not uncommon for presidents to send messages at more than one step. Two-fifths of bills with urgencies were deemed so in two or three steps of the legislative process---the first chamber, the second, and/or the bicameral conference.

%% % \section{Discussion}

%% % The more difficult it is for an assembly to form and maintain majorities capable of passing legislation, the more attractive it becomes to delegate responsibility to the executive.  Specific examples of situations where decrees may become more attractive are systems where legislative parties have a chronic incapacity to discipline members (as in Brazil), or bicameral systems where malapportionment typically produces majorities of different parties in each house, as in Chile before the removal of appointed senators in 2006 \citep[see][]{carey.shugart.1998a,cox.mccubbins.2001}.

%% % A theme worth pursuing are the determinants of unilateralism.  The logic behind executive vetoes (a concurrent consent institution) extends naturally to executive decrees (a restricted unilateralism institution). In the Linzian framework,\footnote{``[T]here is no democratic principle to resolve [conflict]'' \citeyear[][7]{linz.1994}.} unilateralism appears as unconstitutional moves by the executive to bypass the legislature in the context of impasse---an indicator of deep polarization (also O'Donnell). Presidential unilateralism is tantamount to a democratic system overheating dangerously, perhaps ready to melt into authoritarianism.  The factor driving decree incidence is, again, polarization between the branches. Is there evidence? 

%% % Because it pays attention to a single case giving no constitutional decree authority to its president, Cameron's work remains silent about executive unilateralism.  But following the logic of the bargaining approach, decrees should simply represent one additional tool that the president can resort to in his or her quest for influence on policy.  The veto power has a ``second face'' pointing to silent influence through a capacity of players to anticipate each other's acts; uncertainty reduces that capacity, prompting mistakes and a strategic use of them to gain reputations of toughness in bargaining \citep{cameron.2000,mccarty.1997}.  In the same fashion the decree power hides a second face (e.g. Congress makes a slightly larger concession to the president to avoid a decree of his or hers), and to the extent that players have incomplete information, some should occur and be rescinded as mistakes and reputation-building maneuvers.  

%% % Decrees can also be construed as part of a position-taking game.  It seems plausible that a president decrees some policy knowing, beforehand, that it will be rescinded by the assembly.  The intention is to force the assembly to reject policy popular to his constituents, increase the salience of the issue, and subsequently exploit this when campaigning (or give fellow party members a banner to fly in their campaigns).  Similarly, the assembly may concoct a bill attempting to avoid an executive decree modifying it; in doing so it may miscalculate and make insufficient concessions to the president, prompting the decree which legislators meant to avoid.  



%% \section{Closing remarks}

%% Inspection of urgency message predictors and committee reporting within the time frame that presidential messages set forth has uncovered evidence consistent with consequential urgency authority in Chile. The paper is far from conclusive, however: other than raising an abstract cost of ignoring urgent calls, why members of Congress heed executive cheap talk remains a puzzle. But patterns in the data suggest a promising area for research.

%% The big challenge is a method to deal with the selection problem complicating analysis of the urgency--bill passage relation. I close with a look at the bigger picture to give an idea of this obstacle. Figure \ref{F:billPaths} follows President Piñera's proposals ($N=394$) along the full bicameral legislative process, keeping Cámara- (left panel) and Senate-initiated bills (right) separate. The diagram reports relative numbers of proposals in the different paths (atop arrows), distinguishing proposals that proceeded to the next node (i.e., bills that passed, possibly amended) from those that did not (bills rejected, pending, or never considered). It also separates bills that became urgent (the dashed paths) from those that did not. Plots show that urgencies cannot always overcome obstacles in the process. Piñera faced an opposition-controlled Senate throughout his term, yet declared similar proportions of Cámara- and Senate-initiated bills urgent (75 and 79 percent, respectively). The key difference is related to presidential anticipation of rougher terrain in the upper chamber, Piñera sending four out of five proposals to the Cámara. Those he did sent to the Senate were, in fact, less likely to proceed to the next node than the Cámara-initiated ($17+61=78$ v\ $13+48=61$ percent). Also noteworthy is that half as many urgencies in the Cámara failed to move the bill forward compared to the Senate  (14 v 31 percent). If urgency messages trigger reports to the Congressional floor in predictable ways, they are certainly no guarantee of executive success: two out of five urgent Senate-initiated bills ($31/79$) never reached the revising stage, and one-fith in the lower chamber ($14/75$). Few chamber of origin differences arised once legislation reached the second node (relative to the traffic arriving there). Only the shares of bills amended in revising chamber, and therefore sent back to the originating, are somewhat different ($(25+6)/78=.4$ for Cámara-initiated bills, $(23+6)/61=.48$ for Senate-initiated bills). Differences arise again in the third node (when the originating chamber can either concur with amendments by the revising or proceed to conference). Interestingly, the share of urgent bills in third node not proceeding further collapses to zero, regardless of chamber of origin. But the proportion of urgent Senate-initiated bills ($18/(23+6)=.62$) was substantially higher than the Cámara-initiated ($11/(25+6)=.35$). Urgency and success are more strongly associated at later stages of the legislative process. 

%% The urgency authority in the continent is an institution worth studying more carefully. The next chapter inspects it in Brazil, where it is related to executive unilaterlism. Unlike Chile's, the Brazilian reversionary outcome and agenda play in favor of executive influence, simplifying analysis considerably.

%% %To stimulate debate, I close with a bigger picture of the urgency--bill passage relation. Figure \ref{F:billPaths} follows 394 proposals by President Piñera along the bicameral legislative process. Facing an opposition-controlled Senate throughout his term, Piñera chose to send four out of five bills to the Cámara. The diagram reports relative numbers of proposals in the different paths (atop arrows), distinguishing proposals that proceeded to the next chamber (i.e., bills that passed, possibly amended) from those that did not (bills rejected, pending, or never considered). It also separates bills that became urgent (the dashed paths) from those that did not. Initial differences across chambers are notable: if shares of bills tagged urgent in the Cámara and Senate are very similar (75 and 79 percent, respectively), nearly one-fifth more proceeded to the next node in the former than the latter ($17+61=78$ vs.\ $13+48=61$ percent). The failure differential may explain the executive's preference for lower-chamber initiation, but not why Piñera still chose to initiate 90 bills in the Senate. Also noteworthy is that half as many urgencies in the Cámara failed to move the bill forward compared to the Senate  (14 and 31 percent, respectively). If, as seen in the chapter, urgency messages trigger movement in Congress in predictable ways, they are certainly no guarantee of executive success: two out of five urgent bills in the Senate ($31/79$) never reached the Cámara, one-fith in the lower chamber ($14/75$) did not make it to the Senate. Moving to the next node in the legislative process reveals that most inter-chamber differences vanish in the revising chamber: proportions of bills passed unamended by the second chamber and therefore sent to the executive's desk are similar ($(12+24=36)/78=.46$ for Cámara-initiated proposals and $(8+18=26)/61=.43$ for the Senate-initiated), as are shares of proposals declared urgent ($57/78=.73$ and $47/61=.77$, respectively) and shares of urgencies failing to push the bill forward ($7/57=.12$ and $6/47=.13$, respectively). Only the shares of bills amended in second chamber and therefore sent back to the originating chamber change slightly ($(25+6)/78=.4$ for Cámara-initiated bills, $(23+6)/61=.48$ for Senate-initiated bills). And differences reappear further down, the originating chamber concurring with amendments more often in Cámara- than in Senate-initiated bills (.77 v .62), less bills calling for urgency (.35 v .62), and fewer going to conference. While the urgency authority is certainly related to success, it is hardly determinant.

%% \subsection{Lagged weekly urgency models}

%% The models reported in the text consider three proposal subsets separately: executive bills that were referred to the Hacienda committee; members bills that were referred to the Hacienda committee; and all executive bills. The dependent variable is \emph{nReports}, equal to the number of bills from a given subset reported weekly to the Cámara's floor. The general regression form is $\mathit{nReports}_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathit{nUrgencies}_t + \beta_2 \mathit{nUrgencies}_{t-1} + ... + \texttt{controls}_t$, where \emph{nUrgencies} are weekly urgencies raised on bills in some subset; $\texttt{controls}$ are regressors not reported in table \ref{t:negbin}; $t$ is the current week, $t-1$ the week before, and so forth, up to four lags. Some specifications count \emph{nReports} and \emph{nUrgencies} over the same proposal subset to evaluate the direct influence of messages over their target proposals: Hacienda-referred executive proposals in model 11, all executive proposals in model 15, and Hacienda-referred member proposals in model 14. The others evaluate cross-over effects by counting \emph{nReports} and \emph{nUrgencies} over different subsets: Hacienda-referred member bills and Hacienda-referred executive bills, respectively, in model 12; Hacienda-referred executive bills and Hacienda-referred member bills, respectively, in model 13; and member bills and executive bills, respectively, in model 16. Figure \ref{f:vennNegBin} offers a summary of subsets and regression designs.

%% Other controls in the right side, all measured at week $t$, are net presidential aproval, the percentage of the term remaining (executive and Cámara were elected concurrently in the period), and a dummy distinguishing the 2010--2014 Legislature from the 2006--2010 baseline. Weeks when the chamber did not meet were dropped, adding any of that week's reports to the closest next week with a session. Bill histories date reports when officially received by chamber staff (when they entered the so-called \emph{cuenta}, the official tally), which may be days before plenary announcement. The algorithm coded these dates incorrectly, explaining reports dated in session-less weeks. The same could happen for weekly urgency messages, corrected likewise.

%% The median Cámara session week in the period had one bill reported by Hacienda and four by any committee (with deviations of 1.5 and 5.9, respectively). Given the limited nature of the dependent variable (a count), negative binomial regression was used for estimation \citep{cameron.trivedi.1998}.

%% % recover regression tables and report in the appendix; estimate senate versions and report

%% %It includes the Cámara's spontaneous reports and reports presumably triggered by urgency message. If the urgency authority is consequential, the number and type of weekly urgency messages should correlate with total weekly reports. 

%% %Two quantities were aggregated for analysis: weekly Hacienda committee reports, and weekly reports from any committee. The Hacienda aggregate seems preferable, letting analysis search for correlation with urgency messages explicitly targeting bills that were referred to that committee. The total aggregate offers less control, but a more comprehensive picture. 

%% %Analysis, at this stage, does not control for exceptions to the post-urgency report expectation, such as bills that had been reported before the urgency message was issued. But, unless there is a reason to suspect that most or many urgency messages arrive after the committee has reported---and I see no a priori reason to expect this---a relatively large number of messages should be followed by a report. And the report's timing should bear relation to the degree of the urgency. 

%% % Maybe useful to close the appendix subsection
%% %Inspection of Hacienda committee scheduling and activity in detail should prove illuminating. Qualitative inspection of the issues declared urgent, of the urgency messages and their content (especially the recommendations that the messages communicate), and of committee reports themselves will shed light on whether or not, and how cost $k$ is supporting a consequential urgency authority in Chile. The level of urgency results certainly do.
